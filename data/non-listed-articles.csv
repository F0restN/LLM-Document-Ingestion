0,Delirium,"Delirium is a type of confusion that happens when the combined strain of illnesses, environmental circumstances or other risk factors disrupts your brain function. It’s more common in adults over 65. This condition is serious and can cause long-term or permanent problems, especially with delays in treatment. However, it’s also often preventable.",https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia
0,Delirium,"Overview What is delirium? Delirium is a fast-developing type of confusion that affects your ability to focus your attention and awareness. It happens when there’s widespread disruption in brain activity, usually because of a combination of factors. Delirium is more common in medical settings, such as during long hospital stays or in long-term care facilities.",https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia

It can come and go, getting better or worse from hour to hour.	It gets slowly and progressively worse. Is it preventable?	Yes, in up to one-third of cases.	No. Is it treatable?	Yes, especially with treatable causes.	No, but some symptoms are treatable. Can it get better?	Yes, but recovery is less likely or will take longer without treatment.	No. Dementia is permanent. What are some other terms for delirium? One of the biggest reasons why delirium often goes unrecognized is because there’s a history of describing it using different terms or names. Today, healthcare providers use this term very specifically.",https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia

Encephalopathy. Symptoms and Causes What are the symptoms of delirium? Delirium indicates a widespread disruption in brain activity. That means there are many possible symptoms of delirium. It’s also important to remember the symptoms may look different from one person to the next. It can also fluctuate. Delirium can often get better during the day and worse as nighttime approaches, which is why this condition sometimes gets the incorrect name of “sundowning.”",https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia

0,Delirium,"Typical activity level: You’re still confused and not fully aware of your surroundings, but your activity level is similar to what’s usual for you. Shifting activity level: You shift back and forth between the hyperactive and hypoactive delirium types. Sometimes you may show hyperactive symptoms but then change to hypoactive symptoms. This can also involve hypoactive symptoms and sleeping during the day, and hyperactive symptoms like agitation or aggression at night. What causes delirium? Available research indicates that delirium is a complex condition that doesn’t happen for a single reason. Instead, delirium occurs when the “balancing act” between your functional capacity, your functional limitations and other stressors gets pushed too far. On one side is your functional capacity. That’s how much you can handle and recover from without being overwhelmed. On the other side are stressors. That’s anything that makes it harder for your body to work as it should.",https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia

Trouble hearing or seeing what’s happening around you.	Lack of sleep. Lack of mobility. Lack of social interaction. Lack of natural light to help you tell day from night. Your body and mind can keep working or recover from problems as long as you have enough functional capacity. But risk factors reduce your functional reserve. The more stressors and risk factors you have, the easier it is for delirium to happen. When stressors outweigh your functional reserve capacity — either on their own or because risk factors make you more vulnerable — you can develop delirium.",https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia
0,Delirium,Stressors (causes and contributing factors) The possible factors that can contribute to developing delirium in a medical setting include:,https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia
0,Delirium,"Conditions you have. People with dementia have a higher risk of developing delirium. Many conditions, such as cancer, infections (including HIV, pneumonia or COVID-19), sepsis or stroke can make it more likely to happen. People with a recent bone fracture are also at higher risk for developing delirium. Procedures you undergo or treatments you receive. People who undergo major surgery, especially unplanned urgent or emergency surgery, have a much higher risk of developing delirium. Intubation or mechanical ventilation can also make it much more likely to happen. Mobility. Not moving for extended periods, especially lying down, can affect brain function. People who move and participate in physical therapy have a lower risk of developing delirium, and delirium is shorter if they do still develop it. Tethers. This term refers to anything attached to or inserted into your body that limits how you move. This includes intravenous (IV, into your vein) lines or Foley catheters (inserted devices that drain pee directly from your bladder), oxygen tubes or physical restraints. Even minor devices like a heart monitoring sensor patch can be a tether. Medications you take. Some medications can increase your risk of developing delirium, even when used as prescribed. Because of this, healthcare providers often avoid prescribing certain medications to people 65 and older or those with a history of certain conditions. Polypharmacy, taking more than five medications at a time, also increases your risk. Nonmedical drug or medication use. Nonmedical use of drugs, including using prescription medications in a way other than prescribed, can cause drug-induced delirium. Your environment. Natural lighting helps your body maintain its sense of night and day, and losing that sense can greatly increase your risk of developing delirium. Sound is another sense that can affect your sleep/wake cycle. Lack of sleep is a significant contributor to delirium. Lack of pain management. Poorly managed or unmanaged pain can contribute to your risk of having delirium. Stimulation (or lack of it). Your body needs sensory input, and if you aren’t getting it, this can negatively affect your brain (especially as you get older). People who need hearing aids or eyeglasses have a higher risk of developing delirium, especially if they aren’t using these assistive items. End-of-life factors. Delirium is possible during the end stages of life, especially for people receiving palliative care or hospice care. Social isolation. Separation or isolation from family, friends and loved ones can worsen delirium. Family members are valued members of the treatment team and can assist in keeping you aware of your surroundings. People who have family members visiting have a lower likelihood of developing delirium and/or have fewer days where they experience delirium. Risk factors Several risk factors can make it easier to develop delirium. They include:",https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia
0,Delirium,"Age (especially 65 and older). Many changes that happen naturally as you age also increase your risk of developing delirium. Dementia (or other degenerative brain diseases). Delirium can happen more easily in people who have an existing condition that affects brain functions. All degenerative and age-related brain diseases can contribute to delirium or make it more likely to happen. Other chronic physical conditions. Diseases and conditions like heart disease and COPD put a strain on your body. That strain can make it easier for delirium to happen. The more chronic conditions like these that you have, the greater the strain and the higher the risk. Mood disorders. A history of mood disorders, particularly depression, increases your risk of developing delirium. Vision and hearing loss later in life. Your senses, especially vision and hearing, help you know what’s happening around you. Loss of those senses reduces your brain’s ability to use cues from the outside world, making it easier for delirium to develop. Misuse of alcohol and nonmedical drug use. Nonmedical opioid and benzodiazepine drug use strongly increases the risk of developing delirium. Previous history of delirium. People with a history of delirium are at higher risk of developing it in the future. Frailty. This medical term describes how vulnerable you are to illness or injury. Frailty naturally increases as you get older. That’s why a fall for a young adult may not cause any injury, but a similar fall for someone over 65 can be more dangerous. Likewise, physical frailty makes it easier to develop delirium, especially later in life. What are the complications of delirium? Delirium involves widespread disruption in brain activity, which can lead to many complications. They range from minor and short-lived to severe and permanent. Complications to know about include:",https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia
0,Delirium,"New-onset dementia or worsening of existing dementia. Falls and traumatic injuries. Long-term or permanent brain function problems (cognitive impairment).

0,Delirium,"Regular delirium assessments: Rounding and tracking mental state can help providers catch subtle warning signs that mean delirium could develop. Make natural lighting a priority. Using natural light during the daytime and providing enough darkness at night help your body’s natural timing stay accurate. Staying oriented to the time of day can be a big help in preventing delirium. Use glasses and hearing aids. Vision and hearing problems can increase the risk of developing delirium or make it worse. Eyeglasses and hearing aids can help your brain process information about the world around you. Early mobility is key. People who move around early in treatment (with medical guidance) had a lower risk of developing delirium in large clinical trials. Your healthcare providers will tell you if this is possible for you and will help you do this safely. Following provider instructions in this area is absolutely critical to preventing injuries, especially falls. Never try to help a loved one stand up or move unless a healthcare provider tells you it’s OK for you to do so. Minimize tether effects. Tethers include anything that can make it harder to move around. This includes IV and oxygen lines, urinary catheters and physical restraints. Healthcare providers will use regular “tether assessments” to minimize how these items contribute to delirium. Mental exercise. Keeping your brain aware of the date, time and situation, especially with calendars and clocks, can help reduce your risk of delirium. Family members and loved ones can assist with mental exercise and stimulation with the instruction of your care provider. How loved ones can contribute to delirium prevention. Loved ones can play a significant role in preventing and addressing delirium for someone in a medical setting.

0,Delirium,"Visit. Social interactions with family, friends and other loved ones can be a major help in preventing delirium. If your loved one is in a hospital or medical facility setting, be sure to follow the rules and guidelines for visiting, too. Phone or video calls are also helpful for those who can’t make it in person. Talk. Conversations that go beyond simple small talk are a fantastic way to help a loved one stay oriented. Try to engage their memory and talk about things they enjoy or find interesting. Be sure to talk to them like adults and avoid talking to them like you would a child. Decorate and provide familiar objects. Setting up photos that your loved one recognizes and emotionally connects to can be a helpful way to keep them connected to their surroundings. Familiar items, like a treasured blanket or a vase with their favorite kind of flowers, may also help. Engage. Participate in activities with your loved one, if possible. Board and card games, puzzles, and watching TV or listening to radio programs can all be good shared activities. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have delirium?
