5,"What Are Frontotemporal Disorders? Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","Corticobasal syndrome can be caused by corticobasal degeneration — a gradual atrophy (shrinkage) and loss of nerve cells in specific parts of the brain. This degeneration causes progressive loss of the ability to control movement, typically beginning around age 60. The most prominent symptom may be apraxia, the inability to use the hands or arms to perform a movement despite normal strength, such as difficulty closing buttons or operating small appliances. Other symptoms can include muscle rigidity and difficulty swallowing. Symptoms may appear first on one side of the body, but eventually both sides are affected. Occasionally, a person with corticobasal syndrome first has language problems or trouble orienting objects in space and later develops movement symptoms. Not everyone who has corticobasal syndrome has problems with memory, cognition, language, or behavior. Progressive supranuclear palsy causes problems with balance and walking. People with the disorder typically move slowly, experience unexplained falls, lose facial expression, and have body stiffness, especially in the neck and upper body — symptoms similar to those of Parkinson’s disease. A hallmark sign of this disorder is trouble with eye movements, particularly looking down. These symptoms may give the face a fixed stare. Problems with behavior, memory, problem solving, and judgment can also develop.

5,"What Are Frontotemporal Disorders? Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","Try to accept rather than challenge someone with behavioral symptoms. Arguing or reasoning will not help, because they cannot control their behaviors or see that they are unusual or upsetting to others. Instead, be as sensitive as possible and understand that it’s the illness “talking.” Take a “timeout” when frustrated — take deep breaths, count to 10, or leave the room for a few minutes. To deal with apathy, limit choices and offer specific choices. Open-ended questions, such as “What do you want to do today?” are more difficult to answer than specific ones, such as “Do you want to go to the park or for a walk?”. Maintain a regular schedule, reduce distractions, and modify the environment to reduce confusion and improve the person’s sleep. If compulsive eating is an issue, consider supervising eating, limiting food choices, locking cabinets and the refrigerator, and distracting the person with other activities. To ensure the safety of a person and his or her family, caregivers may have to take on new responsibilities or arrange care that was not needed before.",https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia

6,"What Are Frontotemporal Disorders? Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","Try to accept rather than challenge someone with behavioral symptoms. Arguing or reasoning will not help, because they cannot control their behaviors or see that they are unusual or upsetting to others. Instead, be as sensitive as possible and understand that it’s the illness “talking.” Take a “timeout” when frustrated — take deep breaths, count to 10, or leave the room for a few minutes. To deal with apathy, limit choices and offer specific choices. Open-ended questions, such as “What do you want to do today?” are more difficult to answer than specific ones, such as “Do you want to go to the park or for a walk?”. Maintain a regular schedule, reduce distractions, and modify the environment to reduce confusion and improve the person’s sleep. If compulsive eating is an issue, consider supervising eating, limiting food choices, locking cabinets and the refrigerator, and distracting the person with other activities. To ensure the safety of a person and his or her family, caregivers may have to take on new responsibilities or arrange care that was not needed before.",https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia
6,"What Are Frontotemporal Disorders? Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","Medications are available to treat certain behavioral symptoms. Antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are commonly prescribed to treat social disinhibition and impulsive behavior.

7,"What Is Dementia? Symptoms, Types, and Diagnosis","Alzheimer’s disease, the most common dementia diagnosis among older adults. It is caused by changes in the brain, including abnormal buildups of proteins known as amyloid plaques and tau tangles. Frontotemporal dementia, a rare form of dementia that tends to occur in people younger than 60. It is associated with abnormal amounts or forms of the proteins tau and TDP-43. Lewy body dementia, a form of dementia caused by abnormal deposits of the protein alpha-synuclein, called Lewy bodies. Vascular dementia, a form of dementia caused by conditions that damage blood vessels in the brain or interrupt the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain. Mixed dementia, a combination of two or more types of dementia. For example, through autopsy studies involving older adults who had dementia, researchers have identified that many people had a combination of brain changes associated with different forms of dementia. Scientists are investigating how the underlying disease processes in different forms of dementia start and influence each other. They also continue to explore the variety of disorders and disease processes that contribute to dementia. For example, based on autopsy studies, researchers recently characterized another form of dementia known as LATE.

7,"What Is Dementia? Symptoms, Types, and Diagnosis","Cognitive and neurological tests. Used to evaluate thinking and physical functioning, these tests include assessments of memory, problem solving, language skills, and math skills, as well as balance, sensory response, and reflexes. Brain scans. These tests can identify strokes, tumors, and other problems that can cause dementia. Scans also identify changes in the brain's structure and function. The most common scans are: Computed tomography (CT), which uses X-rays to produce images of the brain and other organs Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of body structures, including tissues, organs, bones, and nerves Positron emission tomography (PET), which uses radiation to provide pictures of brain activity — such as energy use — or specific molecules in different brain regions. Psychiatric evaluation. If someone is experiencing behavioral or mood changes, a psychiatric evaluation may be recommended to help determine if depression or another mental health condition is causing or contributing to a person's symptoms. Genetic tests. Some forms of dementia are caused by a person’s genes. In these rare cases, a genetic test ordered by a doctor can help people know if they have the altered genes. It is important to talk with a genetic counselor before and after getting tested, along with family members and the doctor. There are also genetic tests that look for genetic variations that affect someone’s risk of developing dementia, but these tests cannot be used to diagnose dementia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests. CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord, providing protection, insulation, and nutrients. Doctors collect CSF by performing a lumbar puncture, also called a spinal tap. Measuring the levels of proteins or other substances in CSF may be used to help diagnose Alzheimer's or other types of dementia. Blood tests. It is now possible for many doctors, dependent on state-specific availability reflecting U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines, to order a blood test to measure levels of beta-amyloid, a protein that accumulates abnormally in people with Alzheimer’s. Several other blood tests are in development. At present, blood test results alone should not be used to diagnose dementia, but may be taken into consideration along with other tests. However, the availability of these diagnostic tests is still limited. Some of the tests and procedures used to diagnose dementia may not be covered by health insurance.

The difference lies largely in the timing of cognitive (thinking) and movement symptoms.",https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia
8,"What Is Lewy Body Dementia? Causes, Symptoms, and Treatments","In DLB, cognitive symptoms develop within a year of movement symptoms. People with DLB have a decline in thinking ability that may look somewhat like Alzheimer's disease. But over time, they also develop movement and other distinctive symptoms of LBD.",https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia
8,"What Is Lewy Body Dementia? Causes, Symptoms, and Treatments","In Parkinson's disease dementia, cognitive symptoms develop more than a year after the onset of movement symptoms (for example, tremor or muscle stiffness). Parkinson's disease dementia starts as a movement disorder, with symptoms such as slowed movement, muscle stiffness, tremor, and a shuffling walk. These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Later on, cognitive symptoms of dementia and changes in mood and behavior may arise.",https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia
