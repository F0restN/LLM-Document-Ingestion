 To seek help from others even though my relative may object. I recognize the limits of my own endurance and strength.
 To maintain facets of my own life that do not include the person I care for, just as I would if he or she were healthy. I know that I do everything that I reasonably can for this person, and I have the right to do some things for myself.
 To get angry, be depressed, and express other difficult feelings occasionally.
 To reject any attempt by my relative (either conscious or unconscious) to manipulate me through guilt, anger, or depression.
 To receive consideration, affection, forgiveness, and acceptance for what I do for my loved one for as long as I offer these qualities in return.
  To take pride in what I am accomplishing and to applaud the courage it has sometimes taken to meet the needs of my relative.
 To protect my individuality and my right to make a life for myself that will sustain me in the time when my relative no longer needs my full-time help.
 To expect and demand that as new strides are made in finding resources to aid physically and mentally impaired older persons in our country, similar strides will be made toward aiding and supporting caregivers.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/guide-taking-care-yourself/,A Guide to Taking Care of Yourself,"“The care you give to yourself is the care you give to your loved one,” said a caregiver. Absolutely the easiest thing for someone to say and the hardest thing to accept is the advice to take care of yourself as a caregiver. It is often hard to see beyond the care tasks that await you each morning.
What is shown by study after study is that caregiving compromises health. About 60% of caregivers show signs of clinical depression, and caregivers take more prescription medications, including those for anxiety and depression, than others in their age group. Reluctance in asking for and accepting help is a major barrier to getting necessary respite and support. Who has time to think about breaks when there is a diaper that needs to be changed? Seventy-five percent of caregivers in America are women, some taking care of spouses/partners, some adult children taking care of parents, some parents taking care of adult children. What does taking care of yourself mean, why is it so hard to do, and how do you do it?",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/guide-taking-care-yourself/,A Guide to Taking Care of Yourself,"Support and coping comes in many forms—prayer, talking to family, friends or professionals, saying “yes” to offers of help, taking walks, reading a book, eating hot fudge sundaes. But most caregivers end up withdrawing from friends and family and feeling isolated and as if no one understands. Support groups can be an important source of understanding and connection.",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/guide-taking-care-yourself/,A Guide to Taking Care of Yourself,"Guilt that “I should” do this or be able to do it, guilt that your loved one wonʼt get as good care if you aren’t doing it, guilt that something will happen if you are away, guilt about having a good time when someone else is not. As there is no “perfect parent,” there is no such thing as a “perfect” caregiver. And you are not selfish to sometimes think about yourself and your needs and feelings. Although caregivers feel guilty when they get angry or frustrated, these feelings are OK and a way to know how well you are coping. “How can I say it is difficult when I really love this person?” questioned the husband of a client.",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/guide-taking-care-yourself/,A Guide to Taking Care of Yourself,"Learn to ask for help. The often-heard question, “Is there anything you need?” has but one answer: Yes. “Yes, I need a meal, I need someone to stay here so I can go out, I need some time by myself, I need flowers, I need help in the garden, I need some groceries.” Learn to say “no” to requests that are draining rather than nurturing, such as hosting holiday meals. You can still make choices about your life and what is right for you and you do still have some control.",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/guide-taking-care-yourself/,A Guide to Taking Care of Yourself,"Not getting enough sleep is a major cause of illness and stress in caregivers. Exhaustion is one of the main complaints, leading to irritability and then inappropriate anger which then leads to more guilt. Talk with your physician about medication for either yourself or your loved one to help with sleeping through the night. Know the limits of your own endurance and strength. Make sure you have regular check ups and that those “little concerns” about your health are looked into. Exercise is even more important as it gives you a break, combats depression, and helps you maintain health. When I talk with caregivers, one of their fears is worrying about what will happen to their loved one if something happens to them. Worrying doesnʼt help. Taking better care of your health does.",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/guide-taking-care-yourself/,A Guide to Taking Care of Yourself,"Learn as much as you can about the illness so that you can understand what is happening. Attend a workshop or support group, not just for emotional support but also to learn caregiving tricks to make caregiving easier. You can’t know it all; this is a job you werenʼt trained to do. Contact someone who can help you connect with community resources and use them.",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/guide-taking-care-yourself/,A Guide to Taking Care of Yourself,"Taking care of yourself may mean dealing with family problems. How can you make your siblings pull their weight? Possibly you canʼt, and learning how to have a family meeting or work around them is essential for survival. One family actually has a chart and marks off what each does so no one can say, “You aren’t doing your share.” It is easy to become overwhelmed, thus the need for breaks. One caregiver told me that she deals so much better with her husband when he has been at day care, because when he comes home, she is not already frustrated by him. Without breaks, you begin to question yourself, feel inadequate, and experience burn out. Caregivers are often mourning the loss of the person “who used to be.” Grief and loss need to be acknowledged.
One of the stressors of caregiving is seeing no end to the situation. Having a life and connections outside of caregiving helps you to maintain perspective, so that caregiving doesn’t become oneʼs only reality. You might be interested in the FCAʼs Taking Care of YOU: Self-Care for Family Caregivers, a guide to assist caregivers in facing day-to-day challenges.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/adult-day-care-alzheimers-first-day/,Adult Day Care for Alzheimer’s: The First Day,"The quiet stillness of morning had always been a soothing part of the routine Pat shared with her husband Tom. It was a private time for her to have her coffee, read the newspaper, and check emails. Tom rose a little later, made his own breakfast, and began to work at his desk. But now, with the progression of Tom’s Alzheimer’s disease, Pat counts her personal time among the many things which have slipped away. 
On this morning, however, Pat is taking a step to regain some of that nourishing quiet. Today is Tom’s first day at an Alzheimer’s day center—just one of the different types of day programs available to offer respite to caregivers.
Pat’s morning ritual had changed in response to her husband’s gradual decline in function, and Pat had to devote increasing amounts of her attention to Tom’s needs. Though she did her best, Pat says, “I know I was not able to occupy him all the time.”
For Pat, most days used to be filled with getting out and about, running errands, going to the gym. But that’s changed. “I don’t go out nearly as much as I used to. I can’t go out because I don’t know when he might decide to use the stove or go hunting for me and get lost,” Pat explains.  Many caregivers find that their own isolation increases as their loved one withdraws from social situations that become difficult to cope with because of memory loss.
Last week Pat, Tom and their daughter visited an Alzheimer’s  day center. “They are such wonderful people,” Pat says of the staff, “they have such a calling to these people . . . they know all the clients that come and know their families.” While Pat and her daughter were given a tour, Tom was shown the program.  Pat reports that, “I kept watching him, but he never turned around and looked for us.”
Adult day centers for people with dementia and memory loss can provide a necessary—and very welcome—respite to the day-in and day-out tasks of caregiving. Caregivers can become overwhelmed by the additional responsibilities of managing the household and finances. Behavior issues such as repeating questions, “shadowing” the caregiver, and agitation can cause frustration and anger for any caregiver. Alzheimer’s day centers provide a break for the caregivers and afford them time alone in their own homes.   
Day programs provide a safe setting and needed stimulation for the person with dementia, encouraging them to be more engaged and alert. Day program schedules usually run four to six hours, during which time the participant can be involved in activities, enjoy entertainment, have a hot lunch, and receive personal care. Most centers provide services from two to five days a week. Caregivers are free to run errands, attend to their own health needs, work, socialize, or simply relax.
Communicating with Tom about the day center was not easy. When Pat spoke with him about attending “The Club,” as she was advised to call it, she had to drop the subject when he became agitated. With repeated encouragement, Tom agreed to give it a try. “I think deep inside he knows some of it is for me,” Pat suggests.
Pat says she is confident this is the right step, “I thought about if  he would feel I was abandoning him, but at the dementia caregiver support group they said, ‘Don’t wait until it is absolutely necessary; it is better to go when the patient has more cognitive abilities, then they make the transition  better.’ ”
While Tom was at the day center, Pat was able to buy some birthday presents without having to rush home to check on him. She also returned to researching her family genealogy, one of her favorite activities. With all of the tasks and demands of caregiving, hobbies and interests have a way of falling to the very bottom of a caregiver’s list of things which need to be done. Pat plans for Tom to attend the center two days a week. “One day I will do something for myself, and the other I will do chores,” she says. 
Unfortunately, Tom’s first day did not go smoothly. After lunch was finished he was quite adamant about wanting to go home. “I guess it’s a process; I did not realize that,” Pat explains. The staff has suggested that Tom be picked up after lunch, until he adjusts to the program.
Many people with dementia fixate on the caregiver for security. It can be difficult for them, at first, to be separated from their family member.  Although a loved one may have difficulty adjusting, many caregivers come to see that the day center is as much a benefit for themselves as for their loved ones. Pat points out, “It’s good for both parties; you’re not just leaving your spouse, the staff has lots of activities for them.”
Should the day center not work out, Pat already has the information needed to find help in the home through a home care agency.  She has taken advantage of the free family consultation available through Family Caregiver Alliance to discuss care planning and resources for caregivers in her area. Families throughout California can contact their local Caregiver Resource Center to locate a day center near them. Adult day centers are sponsored by a wide variety of programs and organizations. 
Next Tuesday Tom will try the day center again. “It’s a lot, at first, for him to be with strangers and not know where I am,” Pat declares. “But we’re not going to give up.”",dementia

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-cpr-dnr/,Advanced Illness: CPR and DNR,"Big issues—and big decisions—confront us when we think about the imminent death of a terminally ill person in our care. Among the emotional, legal, and financial considerations are also questions regarding the type of medical assistance the person you care for should receive as their illness advances. For example, if they suddenly have difficulty breathing, will you allow a paramedic or an emergency room technician to administer CPR? And if CPR revives the person, yet they still can no longer breathe on their own, should you allow a machine—a respirator—to breathe for them?
A better understanding of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, can be helpful when it comes to making this difficult choice before a crisis occurs. This fact sheet specifically addresses the process of CPR and describes the DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) form, the legal document used to indicate to medical professionals your—or the person you care for’s—wishes.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-cpr-dnr/,Advanced Illness: CPR and DNR,"Consider the following scenario:
Nancy’s husband has had Alzheimer’s disease for eight years, and is now in the final stages of the illness. After a discussion of end-of-life issues with her family, Nancy has decided to “let nature take its course” if anything of an urgent medical nature happens to her husband. In other words, she does not want him to be put on life support. She has told her doctor of this decision, and he has concurred.
One night, Nancy wakes up to find her husband having trouble breathing. Reflexively, without thinking, she calls 911. By the time the paramedics arrive, her husband has stopped breathing completely. The paramedics leap to do their job: they immediately administer CPR and take him to the hospital. By the time Nancy arrives at the hospital, her husband is connected to a ventilator and numerous IVs. Unfortunately, this is exactly what she did not want for him. ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-cpr-dnr/,Advanced Illness: CPR and DNR,"Fully understanding Nancy’s scenario requires a deeper understanding of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Simply put, CPR is the process of restarting the heartbeat and breathing after one or both has stopped. The first step involves creating an artificial heartbeat by pushing on the chest, and attempting to restore breathing by blowing into the person’s mouth. A medical professional will then insert a tube through the mouth and down the airway to make the artificial breathing more efficient. Electric shocks may be given to the heart, and various drugs may be given through an intravenous line. If the heartbeat starts again but breathing is still not adequate, a machine called a ventilator may be employed to move air in and out of the person’s lungs indefinitely.
On television, CPR is often depicted as the ultimate life-saving technique. However, television does not show this process quite accurately—in real life the process is more brutal. Pushing the center of the chest down about one and one-half inches, 100 times a minute for several minutes, causes pain, and may even break ribs, damage the liver, or create other significant problems. CPR produces a barely adequate heartbeat, and doing it more gently is not sufficient to circulate enough blood. Electric shocks and a tube in the throat are also harsh treatments, but may be essential to resuscitate someone.
CPR frequently can save a person’s life, particularly in the case of some kinds of heart attacks and accidents an otherwise healthy person may experience. CPR is also most successful when the failure of heartbeat and breathing occurs in the hospital, in the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU). Nurses in the unit will instantly recognize the problem and begin sophisticated care.
However, when a person is in failing health from a serious and progressive illness, the heart and breathing will ultimately fail as a result of that illness. In such a circumstance, there is little chance that CPR will succeed at all. Any success will be temporary at best, because the person’s weakened condition will soon cause the heartbeat and breathing to fail again.
Another possibility is that CPR may be only partially successful. If the heartbeat is restored but a person is still too weak to breathe on his or her own and remains too weak to do so, he or she may be on a ventilator for days, weeks, months or longer. Moreover, when breathing or heartbeat fails, the brain is rapidly deprived of oxygen. As a result, within seconds, the brain begins to fail (one loses consciousness), and within a very few minutes permanent damage to the brain occurs. If it takes more than those very few minutes to start effective CPR, the person will not fully recover. The brain damage may mean anything from some mental slowing and loss of memory to complete and permanent unconsciousness and dependency on a ventilator and sophisticated medical life support. (See FCA fact sheet: Advanced Illness: Feeding Tubes and Ventilators.)",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-cpr-dnr/,Advanced Illness: CPR and DNR,"A call to 911 is a request for emergency help; the goal of those who respond to 911 calls is to protect life and property, and the people who respond expect to go to work doing what they are trained to do to accomplish that goal. If your house is on fire, the firefighters don’t ask for permission to cut a hole in your roof and spray water all over your living room—they just do what is necessary to stop the fire from destroying your home.
Similarly, when a person’s heartbeat and breathing have failed, the 911 responders are not prepared to have a long talk with you about the person’s condition and what you think might be best to do. They know that any delay could mean brain damage, so they immediately start CPR and then take the person to the hospital. With one exception, which we will discuss in the next section, their rules require this, and it makes sense if you think about the purpose of the 911 system.
When Nancy called 911 in our scenario, the paramedics simply did what they are trained to do—they revived her husband. However, if Nancy and her doctor had completed a DNR form and kept it in the home, her husband would not have been resuscitated and/or connected to machines when he got to the hospital.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-cpr-dnr/,Advanced Illness: CPR and DNR,"The “Emergency Medical Systems Prehospital Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Form” is a legal document that gives the 911 responders permission not to perform CPR. The DNR form is prepared in advance of any situation and kept at home. This prehospital DNR form lists the name of the person to whom it applies, and is signed by that person (or whoever represents that person if he or she is too ill to make medical decisions on his or her own behalf). It is also signed by the person’s doctor. Please note this is very important: the form is not valid until the doctor signs it, as it is a medical order. There is a new form which can replace or be a supplement to the traditional DNR order called a POLST (Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment). See fact sheet Advance Health Care Directives and POLST. 
The DNR or POLST is the only form that affects 911 responders; other documents, such as a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care or some other Advanced Directives, do not. If emergency personnel arrive to find a person whose heartbeat and breathing have failed or are failing, they will perform CPR unless they see a correctly completed DNR/POLST.
In light of this, the DNR/POLST form should be kept near the ill person’s bed, perhaps on the wall, so it will be easy to find in case of emergency. When 911 responders see this form, they will still do anything they can to make the sick person comfortable, but they will not perform CPR. In the absence of a DNR/POLST form, they must do CPR. The DNR/POLST is the only form that gives you control over what they may do. (Note: A DNR may be reversed if you so desire.)",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-cpr-dnr/,Advanced Illness: CPR and DNR,"Why would one choose to prepare a DNR? Because, as we’ve discussed above, there are times when it may not make sense to perform CPR. As an illness progresses, there usually comes a time when continued treatment will no longer reduce symptoms nor heal the person and he/she is in an end stage of the disease. (When a person is becoming more and more sick, doctors may try various treatments to stop the illness, but eventually it may become clear that treatments are not having the desired effect. Other treatments might provide comfort, and might even partly control the disease, but a point may be reached where nothing will stop the person’s decline.) Under these circumstances, you might feel there is little reason to attempt CPR, as it (at this point, CPR) may only prolong dying. This allows natural death to occur. In fact, the original name of the DNR form was “DNAR” for “Do Not Attempt Resuscitation.” This name recognized the fact that the form instructed the 911 responders not to undertake something that, despite the best efforts, would not work effectively in the long run. At most, the effort might put the sick person in the hospital, in pain and distress, for the last days of his or her life. Having a DNR prepared may also relieve the caregiver of making a decision to turn off a machine, which can be an even more difficult decision psychologically.
(See the FCA fact sheets, End-of-Life Choices: Holding On and Letting Go and Decision Making for more discussions about this issue).",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-cpr-dnr/,Advanced Illness: CPR and DNR,"When someone is suffering from a chronic illness, as opposed to an acute illness (the kind that usually requires a hospital visit or stay), the decline is often gradual. As a result, both caregivers and those in their care often forget to talk about the choices the chronically ill person would like to make regarding his or her health care. If you decide that you do not want CPR and are concerned about this decision, it might help to talk with your physician and clergyperson. It is normal, instinctive, to try to save life no matter what, and some people are concerned that not doing everything possible to preserve life is the same as “killing” someone. But it can also simply mean respecting the end stage of a disease as the body shuts down and death naturally occurs.
There are no right and wrong answers to these questions, and until we face a situation like this, it is difficult to anticipate the kinds of choices we’d make. As we change throughout the course of an illness, our choices might also change. However, the more thoroughly family members have discussed these issues in advance of the need to make a critical decision, the easier it will be on both the person who is ill and those responsible for that person’s care. It is never too soon to start the conversation. Hospice care can relieve suffering and provide support to patients and families facing these crises.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-feeding-tubes-and-ventilators/,Advanced Illness: Feeding Tubes and Ventilators,"Families caring for a chronically ill loved one may eventually face very difficult decisions regarding medical treatment for the person in their care. The progression of many conditions—Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or post-stroke, for example—may lead to two of the most common such decisions: whether to use feeding tubes when a chronically ill person can no longer chew and swallow his or her food, and whether to use a ventilator when someone can no longer breathe on his or her own. Given that a person with a chronic illness may be ill for many years, caregivers might put off discussing and thinking about medical complications that are likely to happen in the future. When decline from an illness is gradual, it is easy not to notice the early warning signs of an impending medical crisis. But understanding and discussing these issues ahead of time can help avoid the need to make urgent decisions during a crisis.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-feeding-tubes-and-ventilators/,Advanced Illness: Feeding Tubes and Ventilators,"As many types of neurological illnesses progress, the muscles of the throat gradually cease to work properly. This can cause swallowing difficulties, gagging, choking, trouble coughing, loss of voice, or difficulty catching one’s breath. Receiving proper nutrition is difficult if someone is having trouble swallowing, which is usually accompanied by eating less. The danger of choking while swallowing is that the food can “go down the wrong pipe”—in other words, the food is aspirated into the lungs. Gagging can also cause vomiting, which may cause some of the stomach contents to enter the lungs. All of these possibilities can lead to an illness called aspiration pneumonia, which occurs when bacteria causes infection in the lungs which have been damaged by food or stomach material.
Treating aspiration pneumonia usually requires a hospital stay and a course of antibiotics. Patients may be fed during hospitalization with an NG Tube (naso-gastric tube, inserted through the nose and down the esophagus to the stomach), which allows the patient to receive liquid nutrition. If swallowing difficulties continue, physicians may discuss the use of a G-tube (gastric tube) with the family. Surgery is required to insert a tube directly through the front of the belly into the stomach and the patient then receives all or most of his/her nutrition via frequent “feedings” during the day and/or night. This feeding can be done by hand using a syringe or by using a machine that will drip the liquid through the tube into the stomach. Either way, the patient must be sedentary for a period of time in order to receive the food.
With or without feeding tubes, patients can learn swallowing techniques to reduce the likelihood of aspirating. Caregivers can also help by preparing “thick liquid” diets (thin cream of wheat, mashed potatoes, thickened broths for example), that are easier to swallow, and by avoiding thin liquids and things that require chewing. Some people can enjoy eating small amounts this way, even when they are receiving their primary nutrition through a tube.
In many cases, feeding tubes help prevent illness and prolong life. In diseases like ALS, feeding tubes can be a normal part of treatment, as swallowing may be compromised before a person is in the end stages of the disease.
If someone has trouble swallowing and continues to eat or drink, the possibility of repeated incidences of aspiration pneumonia is high. The decision then becomes how to treat the resulting pneumonias (see “ventilators” below). Some patients truly miss the taste and experience of eating and find normal eating hard to give up. Patients with dementia and/or severe agitation may pull at the tube and/or pull it out, which might require sedation or restraints. And remaining sedentary for the time required to receive the feedings may be difficult.
There is some debate, for example, about whether feeding tubes actually extend life in end-stage Alzheimer’s disease. For many, this is a quality of life issue, and they would prefer to not to live this way. Depending on the situation, people receiving tube feedings may not be able to avail themselves of hospice services.
If the family chooses not to insert a feeding tube, the patient and family may have decided that this person is in the final stages of the illness, and that they are now willing to allow death to occur. If the person is totally unable to eat and does not use a feeding tube, the body will slowly shut down over a period of one to two weeks. Comfort measures are given, so the patient does not suffer, and hospice care can help the patient and family.
Intravenous hydration is the process of giving fluids using a tube in the veins. In the past, IV hydration was used to prevent death from dehydration, which was considered a painful way to die. We now know that gradual dehydration is not painful; rather, it brings a lessening of awareness about discomfort, so that the person slides naturally toward death. If the body is shutting down, it cannot rid itself of the excess fluids given by IV and thus the fluid builds up in the lungs and leads to shortness of breath. Dry mouth is treated more effectively with good mouth care than by IV fluids. With hospice care, it has been the practice not to give IV hydration when someone is close to death. Naturally, pain and other symptoms are still treated as they occur. As with a feeding tube in the advanced stages of an illness, IV hydration can prolong dying rather than prolong living.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-feeding-tubes-and-ventilators/,Advanced Illness: Feeding Tubes and Ventilators,"When a person is diagnosed with a chronic and degenerative illness, it is important for the patient and family members to discuss these topics early in the illness, while the patient is still in a position to let family members know what his/her wishes are regarding these decisions—it is much more difficult to make a decision under the pressure of an acute episode. If the ill person has begun to choke when swallowing, it is a good time for the family, the patient, and, if possible, the physician, to discuss the “what ifs,” and how to think about the choices, keeping in mind the patient’s values. Consultation with clergy may also be helpful. (It is important that our loved ones know how we would come to a decision, remembering that decisions can be changed, if needed, as none of us knows what we will really want until the time comes. Unfortunately, these decisions most often need to be made at a time when we can no longer state our preferences.)
See the FCA Fact Sheets Advanced Illness: Holding On and Letting Go and Holding a Family Meeting for additional help.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-feeding-tubes-and-ventilators/,Advanced Illness: Feeding Tubes and Ventilators,"One of the other choices a patient or family member faces is how to treat pneumonia. Many years ago, pneumonia was called “the old man’s friend,” as many people suffering from chronic illnesses ultimately died of it. This is no longer true, due to modern medicine’s techniques to prevent and treat pneumonias.
Pneumonia, an infection involving the lungs, makes it difficult to breathe, causes pain, confusion and progressive weakness. There are two kinds of pneumonia—bacterial and viral. Bacterial pneumonia can be treated by antibiotics; viral pneumonia cannot, but people can now get a vaccination to prevent many kinds of viral pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia, the kind that can result from difficulty swallowing, is a bacterial pneumonia.
After a stroke or heart attack, or when a patient is in the final stages of an illness such as Alzheimer’s disease, family members and the patient can choose not to treat pneumonia if it occurs. In this case, comfort measures to reduce pain and the distress of labored breathing would be offered, but antibiotics would not be given. Some people recover spontaneously under these circumstances; others die within a week or two.
With bacterial or viral pneumonia, as with initial treatment for a stroke or heart attack or when breathing is compromised by illness, one of the possible treatments involves a ventilator, a machine that helps the person breathe. A ventilator requires a tube down a person’s throat or through a tracheotomy (hole in the throat), also called intubating. When a person is put on a ventilator, it is not always known ahead of time whether it will be for the short or long term. Often a ventilator is used for a short time in treating pneumonia; the patient is then “weaned” off the machine and is able to breathe again on his/her own. Sometimes, however, people are too weak or their illness is so progressed that they will never be able to breathe again on their own. The patient then faces the possibility of remaining on the machine for the rest of his/her life. Even people who have not discussed end-of-life issues may have expressed the desire to not be kept alive “on a machine;” generally, it is a ventilator they are referring to when they say this.
When someone cannot regain the ability to breathe on his/her own, the patient and family may have to decide whether or not to continue using the ventilator. The decision to stop is very difficult to make, particularly emotionally, and, in making it, you may feel as if you have chosen to “kill” the person, although it is, in fact, accepting the natural process of dying. However, like the use of nutritional supplements, use of a ventilator is also a quality of life decision. For some people, staying alive under these circumstances is not acceptable. One way patients and family members can ease the difficulty of this decision is to choose not to use a ventilator as treatment in the first place. Patients can make their wishes known about this through Advanced Directives and discussions with their physicians and family members.
Even with the best advanced planning, patients and family members often must make decisions in a crisis situation. It is natural, even reflexive, to make decisions to prolong life. However, quality of life measures are also important considerations. Each illness has a different course, and being well informed about a loved one’s particular illness can help with the decision-making process. When you know what the choices and consequences are, you can make a decision consistent with a loved one’s wishes and values.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-holding-on-letting-go/,Advanced Illness: Holding On and Letting Go,"Our culture tells us that we should fight hard against age, illness, and death: “Do not go gentle into that good night,” Dylan Thomas wrote. And holding on to life, to our loved ones, is indeed a basic human instinct. However, as an illness advances, “raging against the dying of the light” often begins to cause undue suffering, and “letting go” may instead feel like the next stage.
This fact sheet discusses the normal shifting emotions and considerations involved in holding on and letting go. Exploring these issues ahead of time will allow a person with a chronic illness to have some choice or control over his or her care, help families with the process of making difficult decisions, and may make this profound transition a little easier for everyone concerned.
The opinions of the dying person are important, and it is often impossible to know what those beliefs are unless we discuss the issues ahead of time. In caring for someone with memory loss, it is important to have the conversations as soon as possible, while he/she is still able to have an informed opinion and share it. Planning ahead gives the caregiver and loved ones choices in care and is most considerate to the person who will have to make decisions.
This fact sheet presents principal concerns, then discusses planning ahead, and some of the related matters that come up during chronic illness. Finally, it presents ideas on how to go about making the decisions when the time comes. All along the way, there are few, if any, right or wrong choices. This is a time to seek the answers that most respect the person experiencing advanced stages of an illness.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-holding-on-letting-go/,Advanced Illness: Holding On and Letting Go,"Humans have an instinctive desire to go on living. We experience this as desires for food, activity, learning, etc. We feel attachments to loved ones, such as family members and friends, and even to pets, and we do not want to leave them. We do not so much decide to go on living, as find ourselves doing it automatically. Robert Frost said, “In three words I can sum up everything I have learned about life: It goes on.” Even in difficult times, it is our nature to hold on for better times.
When we realize that the end of life may be approaching, other thoughts and feelings arise. The person who is ill will want to be with loved ones, and may also feel a sense of responsibility towards them, not wanting to fail them nor cause them grief. He/she may have unfinished business. For example, the person may or may not want to reconcile with estranged family members or friends. Fears arise, and may be so strong that they are hard to think about or even admit to: fear of change, of the dying process, of what happens after death, of losing control, of dependency and more. Both the person who is ill and the caregiver might also experience resentment, guilt, sadness, and anger at having to do what neither wants to do, namely face death and dying.
Even in facing death, hope remains. The object of hope may change. As death comes closer, the family may hope for a restful night, or another visit with a particular friend, or just a quiet passing from this life to whatever we hope follows it. Often, as an illness progresses to an advanced stage, two seemingly incompatible ideas may arise in our minds. The Jewish prayer of the gravely ill puts it well for both the person who is ill and the loved ones caring for him/her: “I do not choose to die. May it come to pass that I may be healed. But if death is my fate, then I accept it with dignity.”",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-holding-on-letting-go/,Advanced Illness: Holding On and Letting Go,"As death nears, many people feel a lessening of their desire to live longer. This is different from depression or thoughts of suicide. Instead, they sense it is time to let go. Perhaps, as in other times in life, it’s a sense that it’s time for a major change like one might feel when moving away from home, getting married, divorcing or changing to a new job. Some people describe a profound tiredness, a tiredness that no longer goes away with rest. Others may reach a point where they feel they have struggled as much as they have been called upon to do and will struggle no more. Refusing to let go can prolong dying, but it cannot prevent it. Dying, thus prolonged, can become more a time of suffering than of living.
Family members and friends who love the dying person may experience a similar change. At first, one may adjust to managing a chronic illness, then learn to accept a life limiting illness, and then accept the possibility of a loved one dying. Some may refuse to accept the inevitability of death. Lastly, one may see that dying is the better of two choices, and be ready to give the loved one permission to die. As mentioned, the dying may be distressed at causing grief for those who love them, and, receiving permission to die can relieve their distress. There is a time for this to happen. Before that, it feels wrong to accept a loss, but after that it can be an act of great kindness to say, “You may go when you feel it is time. I will be okay.”",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-holding-on-letting-go/,Advanced Illness: Holding On and Letting Go,"Letting go gets mixed up in our minds with a person wanting to die, although these are really separate situations. There are various reasons a person may want to die, reasons quite separate from those for letting go. Depression is one response to finding life too painful in some way. Some people cannot tolerate losing control, so they want to take control of dying. It can be unpleasant to be disabled, or in a place one does not want to be, or isolated from the important people and things in one’s life. Very often, a severely ill person feels like a burden to family and friends, and may wish to die rather than let this continue. Fears of the future, even of dying, may be so great that a person wants to die to get away from that fear. Inadequately controlled pain or other symptoms can make life seem unbearable.
For many of these situations the right sort of help can make a great improvement, and replace the desire to die with a willingness to live out this last part of one’s life. At this time, professionals such as mental health providers, a hospice team evaluation, or pain-management specialist, may be called upon for consultation.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-holding-on-letting-go/,Advanced Illness: Holding On and Letting Go,"So far, this fact sheet has been about the very end of life. Many, or even most, people go through a period of chronic illness before they die. Along the way there are numerous choices to make. Caregivers and people they care for have to decide whether or not to get a particular treatment or procedure. How long can one keep trying to do usual activities, including work, and when does it seem time for one to face that that phase of life is over? Most of us have things we have dreamed of doing, but never got around to. Now may be the time to do that thing, no matter how difficult, or it may be time to let it be just a beautiful dream. Chronic illness brings up one situation after another where caregivers and care receivers must do their best to communicate about beliefs and options, and then decide either to hold on or to let go.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-holding-on-letting-go/,Advanced Illness: Holding On and Letting Go,"Planning ahead means thinking about what is important, and what is not. It also means talking about this with those close to us. Even though we think we know what someone else thinks and believes, we really do not know until we ask. You cannot read other people’s minds.
When we think about the last part of our own or someone else’s life, consider these questions:
What makes life worth living?
What would make life definitely not worth living?
What might at first seem like too much to put up with, but then might seem manageable after getting used to the situation and learning how to deal with it?
If I knew life was coming to an end, what would be comforting and make dying feel safe?
What, in that situation, would I most want to avoid?
Knowing what really matters to you is worth considering. How important is being able to talk with people, engaging in daily activities, physical comfort or general alertness to you? What comes to mind when you think about the burden of care on others, being at home, or not being there? How much distress is it worth in order to live another month? And what medical procedures are not worth enduring? From your perspective, what is the best way for a person to die, and how important is it to you to be in control of how you live and how you die? Whose opinion should be sought in making choices about the care received when an illness has progressed to an advanced stage?
One especially important matter is to complete the Advance Health Care Directive for both the person who is ill and the caregiver, so that there is an official spokesperson when one is too sick or too confused to speak for him/herself.
If, as caregivers, we haven’t had the necessary conversations—whether due to reluctance, dementia, or a crisis—we might have to think about the issues raised above without a lot of information.
Some questions that might help in thinking about this are:
What has that person actually told me?
How can I find out for sure about her or his wishes?
Turning now to myself as the caregiver, what would be important to me?
What would I especially like to know about that person’s wishes?
What would be the limits of what I could do?
Could I take time off work? How much? What are my financial constraints?
What physical limitations do I have?
What kinds of care would be just too much emotionally for me?
Might I provide more comfort if I let go of some of the daily hands-on caregiving, and allow someone else, even a paid caregiver, to assume this role?
Am I willing to accept the responsibility of being someone’s official spokesperson?
If that person has relatives who would be especially difficult to deal with, how would I manage being the official maker of decisions?
All of these questions may sound very difficult to discuss now, when the time for decisions is still in the future. However, they are harder to discuss when someone is really sick, emotions are high, and decisions must be made quickly. Chronic pain, frailty, and cognitive decline may take away the ability to discuss complicated issues. The earlier everyone sits down to talk, the better. The best way to start is simply to start. Arrange a time to talk. You may say you want to talk about things that might happen in the future, in case of serious illness. Have some ideas to bring up. Be prepared to listen a lot, and to ask questions. Do your best not to criticize what the other person says. If you know the other person will not want to talk much about this topic, have just one or two important things to say or to ask about. Be prepared to break off the conversation, and to come back to it another time. Write down the important things people say. Eventually, you can use your notes to prepare a statement of wishes and make this statement part of an “advance directive” about health care decisions, whether or not the formal document has been completed.
Many families find it is easier to have such a critical discussion with the presence and guidance of an impartial facilitator. Some social workers, case managers, or faith-leaders are skilled in providing this support (see added resources). Asking for a professional to assist with the discussion may relieve individual family members from the burden of having to take on this role.
It is also important to talk with your physician about treatment choices. You may ask the doctor to complete a POLST, or Physician’s Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment. (Visit www.polst.org to find out if your state offers a POLST program, or in states without POLST, ask the doctor about a DNR order—Do Not Resuscitate.) This form is a set of medical orders, similar to the DNR (allow natural death to occur). On this form one can state that he/she does or does not want to be resuscitated, and whether or not one would want a feeding tube, ventilator and other treatments. Decisions to provide or withhold life support are based on personal values, beliefs and consideration for what a person might have wanted. Such decisions are painful. Family members should give themselves ample time to cope with these life and death decisions and to process feelings of doubt, guilt or blame that may surface.
POLST is not for everyone. Only individuals with serious, progressive, chronic illnesses should have a POLST form. For these patients, their current health status indicates the need for standing medical orders. For healthy individuals, an Advance Directive is an appropriate tool for making future end-of-life care wishes known to loved ones (see fact sheet on Advanced Health Care Directives). Professionals in medical offices, hospitals, community-based services, and hospice teams are skilled at assisting individuals or family groups at working with these very normal, but painful, emotions.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advanced-illness-holding-on-letting-go/,Advanced Illness: Holding On and Letting Go,"Is it time to let go? Or time to give a loved one permission to die? There are three ways to help decide.
First, look at the medical situation. Has the illness really reached its final stages? When it has, the body is usually moving on its own toward dying, with strength declining, appetite poor, and often the mind becoming sleepier and more confused. Treatments are no longer working as well as before, and everyday activities are becoming more and more burdensome. In a sense, life is disappearing. Consult with your physician; ask for clarity on the prognosis, or likely course of the illness or stages of dying.
Closer to death, there may be dramatic changes in the dying person’s moods, behaviors, desire to take food or water, and capacity to verbalize wishes. All of this may be a normal part of his or her letting go. At this time, safety and comfort care are of utmost concern.
Second, talk with people you trust. Discuss the situation with the family members and friends who seem to be able to see things as they are. You might also talk with people who are not personally involved. Most importantly, consider what the dying person has expressed or you know to be his or her desires.
Third, listen to your heart. Try to see beyond your fears and wishes, to what love and caring are saying to you. What is really best for the one who is dying, and for the others around? Given that death is unavoidable, what is the kindest thing to do? It might be holding on. It might be letting go.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/alzheimers-disease-caregiving/,Alzheimer’s Disease and Caregiving,"Alzheimerʼs disease (AD) is a condition that causes abnormal changes in the brain mainly affecting memory and other mental abilities. Alzheimerʼs is a disease, not a normal part of aging. Loss of memory is the usual first symptom. As the disease progresses, the loss of reasoning ability, language, decision-making ability, judgment, and other critical skills make navigating day-to-day living impossible without help from others, most often a family member or friend. Sometimes, but not always, difficult changes in personality and behavior occur.
Alzheimerʼs disease poses real challenges for both the person diagnosed with AD and to those who assume caregiving responsibilities. This does not mean that there will no longer be times of joy, shared laughter, and companionship. AD often develops gradually, offering time to adjust to the diagnosis, plan ahead, and spend quality time together.
Nearly 15 million Americans provide unpaid care to a person living with Alzheimerʼs disease or another dementia (Alzheimerʼs Association 2011 Facts & Figures). Dr. Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist and neuropathologist, is credited with identifying the first published case of “presenile dementia” in 1907, a condition that is now called Alzheimerʼs disease.
Alzheimerʼs is the most common form of dementia in older adults. The terms “Alzheimerʼs” and “dementia” are often used interchangeably, but the conditions are not the same. “Dementia” is a term that means a person is no longer able to function on their own because of a lasting impairment of multiple mental abilities affecting memory, attention, and reasoning. Dementia can be caused by many different medical conditions, such as a severe head injury or major stroke. Other common dementias are Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia, and Parkinson’s disease dementia (see FCAʼs fact sheet, Dementia: Is This Dementia and What Does It Mean?).
Although the cause and progression of AD are not fully understood, increasing evidence shows that the first changes in the brain happen as much as 15 years before symptoms of dementia are exhibited by the person with AD. Certain kinds of brain scans can detect these changes. However, this work is not yet advanced enough for it to be of practical use in predicting who will later develop Alzheimerʼs disease.
The prevention of Alzheimerʼs disease is a popular topic in the media. A number of non-medical, lifestyle practices are recommended for possible prevention, a healthy way to manage the disease, and general age-related well-being. There is evidence, but not definitively documented proof, that mental stimulation (brain games), exercise (like walking, swimming, yoga), social activities, and a healthy diet (fruit, vegetables, and foods high in antioxidants) may help.
However, a great deal of evidence does suggest that small strokes are common in people with Alzheimerʼs disease, which only make AD symptoms worse. Given what we know about stroke prevention, maintaining healthy blood pressure, avoiding diabetes or managing it well, keeping cholesterol down, and not smoking are four key things you can do to lower your risk.
This disease can appear as young as age 30, but is typically diagnosed after age 60, and risk of having the disease increases with age. By age 90, as much as 40% of the population may be affected. The genetics of AD are complex, and knowledge is changing rapidly. Except for a small percent of families where a single gene causes the disease, having a family member with AD increases your risk only moderately. Alzheimerʼs disease is reported to be the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/alzheimers-disease-caregiving/,Alzheimer’s Disease and Caregiving,"People with AD may show symptoms of the disease three to five years before diagnosis. This period, when changes are present but the full-blown disease is absent, is called “mild cognitive impairment” or MCI. It is important to understand that not everyone with MCI goes on to develop AD. In fact, as many as 40–50% may never develop the disease. (See the FCA fact sheet Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).) Early problems are often seen as normal changes due to aging, and only in retrospect do caregivers see that symptoms have been occurring for several years. Although on average, individuals survive four to eight years once diagnosed, living for 20 years is not all that unusual. For ease in understanding the changes that occur as the disease progresses, AD is generally divided into three stages: early, middle, and late. However, the development of symptoms in an individual will differ from person to person, as will the progression of symptoms.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/alzheimers-disease-caregiving/,Alzheimer’s Disease and Caregiving,"At present there is no single test that leads to a diagnosis of AD. The doctor first needs to establish that the memory loss is abnormal and that the pattern of symptoms fits AD. This sometimes requires specialized memory testing. The doctor then needs to rule out other illnesses that can cause the same symptoms. For example, similar symptoms can be caused by depression, malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, thyroid and other metabolic disorders, infections, side effects of medications, drug and alcohol abuse, or other conditions. If the symptoms are typical of AD and no other cause is found, the diagnosis is made. In the hands of a skilled doctor, this diagnosis is very accurate.
An evaluation for Alzheimer’s disease is often requested by a family member or friend who notices memory problems or unusual behavior. The doctor typically begins the evaluation by taking a health history and performing a physical examination, as well as evaluating the patient’s cognitive abilities (mental processes of perception, memory, judgment, and reasoning). This approach can help the doctor determine whether further testing is needed. A primary care physician may refer a patient for more extensive examination by a designated Alzheimer’s diagnostic center, or by a neurologist, dementia, or geriatric specialist. This examination will likely include a thorough medical evaluation and history, blood tests, and brain scans (MRI or PET), followed by extensive neurological and neuropsychological assessments. A dementia evaluation should include interviews with family members or others who have close contact with the person being evaluated.
Rapid scientific progress is being made in identifying “biomarkers” of AD. Biomarkers are abnormal findings in blood, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or on brain scans that are markers of AD. Strong evidence suggests that special tests of the CSF may be useful diagnostically. It is also possible now to see amyloid, a key abnormal protein in AD, in the brain using PET scans. As knowledge advances, these tests may come into clinical use. Even now, however, it is clear that they will not be good enough to diagnose AD on their own. The diagnosis will still depend on a skilled and thorough evaluation.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/alzheimers-disease-caregiving/,Alzheimer’s Disease and Caregiving,"No one fully understands what causes Alzheimerʼs disease yet, and currently no cure exists. Considerable progress has been made by researchers in recent years though, including the development of several medications for early-stage AD that can help improve cognitive functioning for awhile.
Three main drugs, donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) and galantamine (Reminyl), have proved beneficial in improving memory, with limited side effects, usually gastrointestinal upset. Exelon comes in a patch form, which is helpful for people who have trouble swallowing pills. Unfortunately, these drugs are not effective for everyone, and their effectiveness is limited to the early and middle stages of AD. Another drug, memantine HCl (Namenda) also prescribed to help delay the progression of AD, is often used in combination with the above drugs. A doctor may also prescribe medications to help reduce agitation, anxiety, and unpredictable behavior, as well as to improve sleeping patterns and treat depression.
New medications are developed and tested regularly. People interested in participating in clinical trials should discuss the pros and cons with their physicians and families. Information on clinical drug trials and other research is available from the Alzheimer’s Disease Education and Referral Center (ADEAR) and FCAʼs Research Registry.
Regular care from a physician is important. Major, sudden changes in mental status can be the main symptom of important treatable conditions such as a urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, or even a bone fracture. If the physician knows the patient, he or she can quickly recognize a change in mental status. But if they are presented with a demented patient that they have not seen in years, it can be extremely difficult to know whether anything has changed and the proper workup may not be initiated.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/alzheimers-disease-caregiving/,Alzheimer’s Disease and Caregiving,"Alzheimer’s disease is called a family disease, because the chronic stress of watching a loved one slowly decline affects everyone. An effective treatment will address the needs of the entire family. Caregivers must focus on their own needs, take time for their own health, and get support and respite from caregiving regularly to be able to sustain their well-being during this caregiving journey. Emotional and practical support, counseling, resource information, and educational programs about Alzheimer’s disease all help a caregiver provide the best possible care for a loved one.
Absolutely the easiest thing for someone to say and the hardest thing to accept is the advice to take care of yourself as a caregiver. As stated by one caregiver, “The care you give to yourself is the care you give to your loved one.” It is often hard to see beyond the care tasks that await you each morning.
Through training, caregivers can learn how to manage challenging behaviors, improve communication skills, and keep the person with Alzheimer’s safe. Research shows that caregivers experience lower stress and better health when they learn skills through caregiver training and participate in a support group(s) (online or in person). Participation in these groups can allow caregivers to care for their loved one at home longer.
When you’re starting out as a family caregiver, it’s hard to know where to begin. Perhaps you’ve only recently realized that a loved one needs assistance and is no longer as self-sufficient as he or she once was. Or perhaps there has been a sudden change in their health.
Now it is time to take action, and take stock of the people, services, and information that will help you provide care. The earlier you get support, the better.
The resources listed at the end of this fact sheet will help you locate local training classes and support groups. (See two of FCA’s fact sheets: Caregiver’s Guide to Understanding Dementia Behaviors, and Dementia, Caregiving, and Controlling Frustration; as well as the article, Ten Real-life Strategies for Dementia Caregiving).
The role of the caregiver changes over time as the needs of the person with AD change. The following table offers a summary of the stages of AD, what kinds of behaviors to expect, and caregiving information and recommendations related to each stage of the disease.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/alzheimers-disease-caregiving/,Alzheimer’s Disease and Caregiving,"Trouble remembering recent events or conversations, the month or day of the week
Asking the same question over and over or repeating stories
Loss of ability to manage finances, making mistakes in writing checks
Withdrawal from social situations and general apathy; trouble initiating an activity

Poor judgment, difficulty making wise decisions; may be easily swayed by others
Tendency to lose things or forget where they are when they are “put away carefully”

Denial that anything is wrong",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/alzheimers-disease-caregiving/,Alzheimer’s Disease and Caregiving,"Learning: The more you know about AD, the easier it will be for you as a caregiver. Learn as much as you can about the early and middle stages of AD; donʼt worry about the late stage yet. Finding other caregivers to talk to can also be a great way to learn about and make sense of your own experience. One of the most difficult things to learn is to differentiate between the disease and your loved one. Particularly in the early stage, caregivers may find themselves thinking, “He’s doing this to spite me!” or “She is just being lazy.” In these cases, the behavior that is upsetting to the caregiver is usually a result of the disease process, not an attempt by the person with AD to hurt or frustrate the caregiver.
Emotional support: A diagnosis of AD can be a heart-wrenching experience for both the person diagnosed and the caregiver. The person with AD may not remember or may not admit to having the disease or ever being told they had Alzheimerʼs. Trying to convince them otherwise is fruitless and frustrating for the caregiver. The caregiver needs to get appropriate emotional support through counseling, a support group, or other family members. The goal is to establish a system of emotional support that will grow and change with you as your caregiving role and the emotional challenges change. Depression is common in caregivers of people with AD and should be addressed.
Family roles: As the disease progresses, it will be harder for the person with AD to fulfill the roles they have typically played in the family. For example, if he or she was the only driver in the family, it will be important for family members to find alternative means of transportation (e.g., learning how to drive, recruiting volunteer drivers from among family and friends, using public transportation or paratransit). If the person with AD customarily prepared all of the meals, now is the time for the caregiver to begin learning how to cook. If the person with AD was in charge of household finances, someone else will need to assume this role. Focusing on these issues early will allow the person with AD to help the caregiver prepare for the future.
Finances: AD can be a costly disease. It is important to begin mapping out strategies for meeting the increasing financial demands placed on the family as the disease progresses. Financial planning should include reviewing your insurance coverage, e.g., health, disability, long-term care. Be aware that Medicare does not pay for long-term care or custodial care. Medicaid, the safety net for those living on a limited income, does provide coverage for those who qualify. Health insurance counseling is available free to seniors. To locate help in your community, see the Eldercare Locator website: eldercare.acl.gov.
Legal: Eventually the person with AD will need help making medical decisions and financial decisions, and in making all sorts of important personal decisions such as who will provide for their care. Legal documents should be completed as early as possible in the disease process, even prior to a diagnosis. Waiting too long may result in the person no longer being deemed capable of signing legal documents. A Power of Attorney for Finances and Power of Attorney for Healthcare (Advanced Health Care Directive) can ensure that the person with AD is cared for by trusted family members or friends. Without these documents, caregivers may have to petition for conservatorship through court proceedings in order to obtain the right to make decisions on behalf of the person with AD. The family may also lose access to bank accounts if a member is not co-named on the account(s). Clear legal documentation can help prevent someone from attempting to take advantage of or lay claim to financial resources for their personal gain. Free and low-cost legal services are available to seniors. See the resource section of this fact sheet for organizations that can help with legal issues.",dementia

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"The goal of this article is to help you care for someone living with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, better known as ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease. It is based on the video “Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Caregivers: You’re Not Alone“. While you may not feel prepared for this role, there are many resources, along with a whole community of professionals and ALS caregivers to help you.
In this article, we’ll look at the early, middle, and late stages of ALS, and focus on caregiving information and recommendations related to each stage. We will also cover what to expect, how to prepare, and provide strategies to help you along the way.
Let’s start with a quick overview.
ALS is a progressive neuromuscular disease that breaks down nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that are responsible for movement. As nerves become affected, a person with ALS experiences muscle weakness and will eventually lose their ability to move, breathe, swallow and speak. However, they may retain many of their senses, including sexual and bodily functions.
ALS symptoms typically appear between the ages of 40 and 70. On average, individuals with ALS live 2 to 5 years after diagnosis, with some people living more than 10 years.
But keep in mind that the disease can progress differently for each person.",amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"In the early stage of ALS, people are still mostly independent.
They may experience:
Muscle weakness, twitching, or cramping in hands or feet
Increased fatigue
Balance issues
Slurred speech
They will need you or another friend or family member to be with them more often for safety. Symptoms can begin in the hands and feet, or with speech and swallowing. Symptoms can continue to spread over time.
An ALS diagnosis involves ruling out other potential causes of these symptoms. Since no conclusive test currently exists for ALS, individuals may initially receive a diagnosis of “probable” or “possible” ALS.
These symptoms—and receiving a diagnosis—can be very distressing. For the person who is newly diagnosed and for their family, participating in a support group can help ease anxiety and teach pro-active coping skills. Individual counseling for you and the person you care for can also be very helpful.",amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"Learn all you can about ALS. Start by connecting with medical providers who understand and have experience with the disease. The ALS Association website contains information on Certified Treatment Centers of Excellence and Recognized Treatment Centers across the United States.
Although there are no cures for ALS yet, there are ways to treat, manage, and slow the progression of symptoms. You may also want to explore current research opportunities where ALS-specific trials are being conducted.
If you are related to someone with ALS, you may be wondering if you should get genetic testing. About 10% of ALS cases are genetic. The ALS Association certified and recognized centers all have genetic counselors who can provide more information and guide you in this process.
Social workers can help connect you to resources and referrals in your community and provide you with supportive counseling. Check with your local Chapter of the ALS Association for a referral to a care manager who can provide you with this support. The ALS Association website can help you find local care services.",amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"How are you feeling about your loved one’s diagnosis? Sadness, anger, fear? Disbelief? Perhaps you feel relief at finally having an explanation for the unusual changes you’ve been observing. All these feelings are normal.
As a caregiver, you may experience many different emotions over time. Feelings of loss and frustration can be profound. Two types of loss that are common for caregivers are “ambiguous loss” and “anticipatory grief.”
Ambiguous loss is the grief we experience when someone is “there but not there” – when they’re not the same person they used to be.
Anticipatory grief occurs when we know a loss is coming, and we begin grieving before they’re gone.
In the early stages, it’s very important to find support to cope with these feelings– even before you think you need it.
Although there is no one right way, there are healthy ways to deal with anxiety, loss and grief.",amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"Journaling: Writing in a journal can help you to name and express your feelings. Many caregivers find journaling, or writing in general, useful, even therapeutic.
Physical exercise
Prayer
Meditation
Relaxation exercises
Support groups
Talking one-on-one with a friend or counselor
Creating new rituals
These activities can help you stay well and build resiliency. Engaging in activities that are fulfilling and decrease stress should be a priority.
ALS can affect everyone in the family in different ways. This includes you as the caregiver, the person with ALS, their relatives, and friends. Each will require their own kind of support.
Children who have a parent with ALS may benefit from talking to a school counselor and checking out resources designed specifically for children on the ALS Association website.
Both you and the person you care for will have to learn to balance ALS symptoms and care needs with the desire to be independent. You both should keep dates with friends, keep up with interests and hobbies, and do the things that fill you with joy as much as possible.",amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"One common question that caregivers ask, is what will happen to the person I care for if something happens to me? One thing you can do is make sure your own legal and financial documents are updated.
This is a good time to encourage the person with ALS to make or update their legal and financial arrangements
Speak to Attorney: For the person you care for, it’s best to speak with an attorney who specializes in disability and estate planning.
Complete Key documents including:
Durable financial power of attorney
Advance Health Care Directive
Will and/or trust
POLST which specifies the type of medical interventions wanted at end of life.
Release of Information: This is also a good time for the person with ALS to sign a release of information, allowing medical staff to speak with you and others who are closely involved in their care.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"Employment Benefits: If you or the person diagnosed with ALS is employed, it is important to contact the Human Resources department to learn about eligible benefits, such as long-term disability and paid and unpaid family leave options.
Government Disability Benefits: Securing financial help from the government can be a challenging and confusing process. We recommend seeking out experts to help you early on. Consult with an attorney, a community organization or legal aid office that specializes in SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance), and SSI (Supplemental Security Income). They can also help you navigate Medicare and Medicaid.
The ALS Disability Insurance Access Act of 2019 eliminated the required five-month SSDI waiting period for applicants who are approved on or after July 23, 2020.
Medicare: Most individuals with ALS are eligible for Medicare once they turn 65 years old or as soon as their SSDI benefits begin.
But it’s important to remember that Medicare does not pay for long-term care, such as care provided in an assisted living, skilled nursing facility or private care in the home. Medicaid will pay for long-term care if the person has very little income and assets.
Veterans Benefits: If the person you care for is a veteran, applying for benefits and enrolling in the VA health care system should be done as soon as possible. Your local ALS Association chapter or Veterans Service Organization can offer guidance about service-connected ALS and assist in completing the necessary paperwork.
Long-Term Care Insurance: Long-term care insurance will help pay for care if the policy was purchased prior to the ALS diagnosis.",amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"In the middle stage, a person with ALS may experience:
Widespread severe muscle weakness
Muscle paralysis
Difficulty breathing
Swallowing, eating, or chewing become harder at this stage.
Individuals may also display bouts of uncontrolled and inappropriate laughing or crying, known as the “Pseudobulbar Affect”.",amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"As symptoms progress, it is common for the caregiver to feel isolated as you deal with new stages of grief and loss.
Too often, just when you really need more support, friends and even family may step back due to their inability to witness your pain and the person you care for’s decline. They may not understand the disease or how to be of help. Some ways to deal with this are to:
Reach out to friends and family with specific suggestions or ways to be supportive.
Contact a social worker for additional resources, or to help facilitate a family meeting.
At this point you may also want to bring in outside assistance from friends or hired caregivers to help with care.
If you’re feeling depressed, anxious, or angry, know that these emotions are hard to deal with on your own. Consider talking with your doctor or counselor and attending a support group or retreat designed for caregivers. There are effective ways to help you cope and feel better. Don’t wait to ask for help!
Take a break! Respite can come from a family member, friend, or paid in-home care provider.
You can also take moments for yourself throughout the day. Even if it’s just 15 minutes to drink a cup of tea, watch a funny video, or do something you enjoy; these intentional breaks can make a big difference!
And if you need more time-off, there are out-of-home respite options, such as adult day programs or a short-term stay in a 24-hour care- assisted living or nursing residence.
Too often caregivers don’t feel they need a break until they experience a crisis or problem with their own health. We encourage you to get respite early and as often as you can.
Some signs that you need more support and time to take care of yourself include:
health issues like a rash or ache that are getting worse
rising blood pressure
your own chronic health conditions aren’t being managed well
trouble sleeping
feeling anxious, irritable and less patient
turning to alcohol or drugs in an effort to relieve your stress
Remember, as ALS progresses, it’s easy to postpone your own healthcare needs. Be sure to prioritize your physical and emotional health!
It may cause you anxiety to take time for yourself because you worry something bad will happen. Or you may feel guilty. The truth is that it’s essential to confront these concerns and make time to step outside of the caregiver role.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"Safety becomes more important during the middle stage of ALS. Connect to the following professionals for assistance in assessing safety issues and obtaining assistance in keeping the person you care for as safe as possible.
Physical Therapist (PT): Because ALS causes loss of motor functions over time, it’s important to identify potential hazards that may exist in the home. A PT can complete an in-home safety evaluation and suggest modifications such as bathroom grab-bars for getting in and out of the shower. PTs can also recommend other types of equipment and strategies to prevent falls and injury.
Occupational Therapist (OT): helps promote independence and safety for the person living with ALS. They can suggest assistive devices and tips to help with daily activities and personal care.
Speech Therapist: People with ALS may experience difficulty speaking, swallowing their food, and drinking beverages due to the weakening and loss of muscle control in the mouth and throat, also known as the bulbar muscles. A speech therapist can make recommendations to help manage speech and swallowing. They can also recommend devices that allow a person with ALS to communicate in a variety of ways.
Dietician: Those who lose muscle control in their hands and arms will need assistance eating and drinking. They may struggle to maintain a healthy weight and proper nutritional intake. A dietitian can help put together a diet that provides for their specific needs. Over time a person with ALS may no longer be able to safely swallow food or liquids, and a feeding tube may be needed.
Palliative Care: Palliative care helps to improve the quality of life for people who have debilitating chronic health conditions. A person doesn’t have to be in the end stages of a disease to qualify. Palliative care teams can help manage symptoms and reduce suffering.
Contact the medical team for referrals to any of these professionals. And if it’s difficult to attend an appointment in-person, ask providers about telehealth or virtual visit options.
If your health insurance does not fully cover the cost of a necessary piece of durable medical equipment or communication device, most ALS Association local chapters offer equipment loan programs.",amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"During late-stage ALS, the person you care for, will need assistance with most or all of their personal care:
Speaking, eating, and drinking may not be possible
Mobility will be extremely limited
Respiration becomes more difficult. Respiratory difficulties that progress over several months can become challenging to manage. However, there are medications to help relieve discomfort.
Talk with the medical team about all the possible ways to help reduce pain and/or suffering and increase comfort. Remember, you are their connection to quality care and services when they are no longer able to advocate for themselves.
There may come a time when the person with ALS requires a higher level of care than can be provided at home. Moving the person to a skilled nursing facility can be a tough decision, but a necessary one for some. You may feel like you’ve failed or that you’re breaking a promise – even when you know that placement will provide more safety and advanced care.
If you’re considering a nursing facility, it’s helpful to get a list of local options and visit them. You can find ratings for skilled nursing facilities at Medicare.gov.
Even if the individual moves to a skilled nursing facility, this doesn’t mean that your role as a caregiver ends. Your presence and advocacy will help to ensure that proper care is provided.",amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als

Hospice is a Medicare benefit for which individuals are eligible when a doctor has determined a patient has six months or less to live. The goal of hospice is making the patient as comfortable as possible.
Care can be provided wherever the person resides, whether at home or in a care facility. Services include visiting nurses, pain management, and personal care. Hospice can also provide spiritual, grief, and bereavement support, as well as respite for family caregivers.
The doctor or medical team may have a particular hospice program they recommend, or you can choose your own. Once you’ve selected a hospice program, you can ask the doctor for a referral to begin services.",amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-als

But other times I've noticed that Ted gets ""stuck"" on a subject and tends to repeat the same thing over and over again. He could ask when dinner is 25 times or more. It's so frustrating. I don't know what to do to get through to him. If I get angry, it just seems to make him upset too. Can you offer me any advice?",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/ask-expert-repeating/,Ask an Expert: Repeating-Answer:,"What you’ve described is a common phenomenon in persons with dementia or brain-impairing conditions like stroke or traumatic brain injury. It’s called “perseveration.”
Perseveration consists of repetitive comments, questions, or even actions (constant tugging at clothing, or rummaging through a purse or wallet). The person is not aware that he or she is repeating the same question or idea. It is more likely that poor short-term memory is the cause of the repeating. The person may be preoccupied with something, like when it’s time to eat, but feel uncomfortable or even anxious because he/she can’t remember when mealtime is.
One strategy in curbing perseveration is to distract the person. If your husband is anxious, try giving him something (non-dangerous) to hold in his hands. A change of activity is a good distraction. Going for a short walk could help. You can look to the possible root cause of his question. Could your husband be hungry? Try offering him a snack.
There is no one way to eliminate this problem; you may have to use a system of trial and error to see what works best. If your husband becomes agitated, it may be a good idea to review his medications with his doctor, to see if any drugs he may be taking could be contributing to the situation, or if a change in prescription could help resolve the agitation.
Lastly, it is important that you, as caregiver, recognize that your husband is not doing this on purpose. Getting some periodic respite (time off from caregiving) can help you cope with problem behaviors and help you keep your own cool.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/assistive-technology/,Assistive Technology-Introduction,"Sometimes called assistive devices, independent living aids, and adaptive equipment, assistive technology (AT) can help your loved one live more independently. Assistive technology may also make your job as a caregiver easier and more enjoyable.
If you’re caring for someone with dementia, you may be worried about his falling, wandering, or getting lost. Certain types of AT can help. A loved one with a physical or cognitive (thinking) impairment can use AT to make activities of daily living, such as dressing, bathing, grooming, eating, and toileting, a little easier.
This fact sheet describes different types of AT that may be helpful to you and your loved one. In addition, it addresses how to find AT, how to pay for devices, and how to decide what devices or home modifications you might need.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/assistive-technology/,Assistive Technology- Definition,"Assistive technology devices are basically helpful products that improve or maintain a person’s ability to live and function independently. Some Assistive technology can be as simple as a hearing aid or cane, or as sophisticated as a voice-activated computer system or mechanical hoist to lift and turn someone in bed. AT is considered “low tech”—canes, magnifiers, and pill organizers—while “high-tech” assistive devices include computer applications and programs, sensors, and smart phone and tablet applications or systems.
AT is a rapidly growing area and is used by people with disabilities and older adults who want to stay in their communities and remain independent as long as possible. In 2003, an AARP survey suggested that close to 15 million Americans with disabilities used some type of AT. Current projections suggest that over 50 million, or close to 20% of Americans use some time of assistive device. In a 2018 update, the World Health Organization states that globally, more than 1 billion people need 1 or more assistive products.  Even with the advance in technology, according to AARP the top three most popular AT devices remain:
Walker, cane, or crutches
Aids for bathing or toileting
Wheelchair or scooter
While some people associate AT with people who have disabilities, older adults can also benefit from all different kinds of AT. An updated 2019 article from AARP notes that by 2030 close to 132 million Americans age 50 and older will spend close to $84 billion a year on technology products. Also 80% of Americans age 50-64 now own smart phones. With rapidly advancing technology, all ages of people now have technology as a part of their daily life. ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/assistive-technology/,Assistive Technology-What Kind of AT Is Right for Your Loved One?,"The area of assistive technology has grown tremendously in recent years, and many manufacturers now provide a wide range of products and devices. It can be confusing to determine which products might be right for your loved one. Here are a few basic tips to help you in this task:
Focus on the actual tasks your loved one wants or needs to do when choosing devices. While this might seem obvious, it’s easy to get drawn into buying a product that looks good but doesn’t really address your loved one’s needs.
Generally, it is best to pick the simplest product available to meet the need. Simpler devices are often easier to use, less expensive, and easier to repair and maintain than more complex devices are.
For example, if someone does not have difficulty remembering to take their medications but gets confused about which pills to take at which times, a weekly pill organizer that can be filled by a caregiver or a pre-filled subscription service would solve the problem. Purchasing an automated pill dispenser with alarms to remind the person to take medications would be more complicated than necessary and would certainly be more expensive than the simpler pill organizer.
Ask other people with disabilities what products they have found to be helpful.
Ask experts who provide care to your loved one, like rehabilitation specialists, occupational therapists, and physical therapists about which type of technology might be best.
Ask to use the device on a trial basis to see if it is truly going to meet your loved one’s needs.
Ultimately, your loved one’s opinion about a certain piece of AT is the most important. The device needs to be comfortable, attractive, and simple to use.
For example, if someone does not have difficulty remembering to take their medications but gets confused about which pills to take at which times, a weekly pill organizer that can be filled by a caregiver or a pre-filled subscription service would solve the problem. Purchasing an automated pill dispenser with alarms to remind the person to take medications would be more complicated than necessary and would certainly be more expensive than the simpler pill organizer.",[]

Modified traditional telephones may use large buttons, headsets, speakerphone capabilities, or keyboard and visual displays to make telephones useable by people who have disabilities.
Computer technology can allow people to stay in contact via email or messaging while more sophisticated technology can employ modified keyboards or voice recognition software to enable individuals who have disabilities to use computers effectively.
Smart phones and tablets now also offer many options with voice-to-text features, voice operated commands, different texting functions, and several applications for communication for many different people to remain or become independent.
Accessible telephones, videophones, captioning, real-time transcription, telecommunication with TTYs and TDDs, and visual alert systems can offer ways for people who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing to effectively communicate.

A 2018 AARP survey notes that 76% of Americans age 50 and older would like to “age in place” or remain in their current residence and community as long as possible. You may be able to make some simple modifications to your loved one’s home with relatively little cost or assistance. For larger modifications, such as widening doorways, lowering counters, remodeling hallways, and installing lifts or elevators, you may need to hire a licensed contractor.
Two useful checklists to determine whether your loved one’s home needs to undergo some changes to make the house safer and more accessible can be found at the following websites: www.homemods.org and www.rebuildingtogether.org.
The following list of independent living aids may provide easy, low-cost installation solutions to a number of problems with home design:
Grab bars, bath seats, and transfer benches
Handrails for stairways
Bathmats and skid-resistant rugs
Glow tape for hazardous furniture
Attachable grips for turning doorknobs, lamp switches, and faucet handles
Lever door handles
Tape or markers for high contrast on stairs or in the bathroom
Other useful home modifications include:
Wheelchair and threshold ramps, which come in a variety of pre-designed sizes with pre-drilled slots for easy installation. Lightweight portable wheelchair ramps can be folded or rolled up for easy transport and storage. Permanent ramps are more expensive due to custom fitting and grading and need to be installed by a contractor.
Elevators and lifts, which need to be installed by a contractor to assure that installations meet code and safety standards. Lifts and elevators are available for most inclined or vertical surfaces, including porches, balconies, and curved or straight stairs.
Also consider that all of these features that make a person’s home more usable also make it easier for people who use different mobility devices to visit a person’s home. “Visitability” is a growing trend in order to prevent social isolation and promote access to all.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/assistive-technology/,Assistive Technology- Types of AT,"Both you and your loved one can have an added degree of security by using AT which alerts you or a medical system if your loved one is in crisis. The following are examples of this type of AT:
Personal emergency response systems (also called medical response systems) use a pendant, bracelet, or belt that your loved one wears. If he or

she has an accident, fall, or other emergency when unattended, a monitor center can be alerted at the press of a button. A monitor will then call the appropriate contacts and emergency services based on the caller’s medical information. This device is intended for persons who  are able to activate the signal and who do not have dementia.
Occupancy monitors may be helpful if your loved one is prone to falls. These monitors use pressure-sensitive chair or bed pads that activate when your loved one moves to get up.
Intercom systems, often called baby monitors, can be used if your loved one lives with you. The intercoms can be left on so that you can hear your loved one from another area of the house.
Webcams and other computerized monitoring systems are more technologically-advanced methods of monitoring a loved one. Webcams are basically video cameras that can allow you to see your loved one and monitor potential problems. Other types of computerized monitoring systems are in development by a number of companies and may use motion detection or other means to monitor your loved one and continually gather and process the information at a central monitoring site that can then alert you if there is a problem.
Smart devices, such as Amazon’s Alexa or Siri on Apple products have become a popular and potentially less expensive way for people who have disabilities to contact and emergency service due to voice activated commands and the ability to have several devices around the home.",[]

Memory aids include jumbo analog wall clocks with daily calendar, talking clocks/wrist watches, voice-activated phone dialers, automated pill dispensers with message machine and timer, and a Find-It beeping device to keep track of small items such as car keys and glasses.
Symbols or warning signs on doors, cabinets and dangerous appliances can help a person with dementia maneuver more safely around the house.
If your loved one wanders or forgets where he or she is, the following can be quite helpful:
Mobility monitors and tracking systems come in a variety of designs, though all usually require that your loved one wear a small ankle or wrist transmitter. The transmitter triggers an alert system, or a receiver which you can monitor, when your loved one passes beyond a set range or exits activated doorways.
Medical ID bracelets have a person’s diagnosis and a 24-hour hotline number inscribed on the bracelet. Such a bracelet can be helpful if your loved one is disoriented and gets lost or has an accident outside of the home. The following two programs are respected:

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/background-checking-resources-help/,Background Checking: Resources That Help,"Stories fill the news about aides who take advantage of, rather than care for, a parent, spouse, or other family member in their home. Drained savings accounts, missing jewelry, and unexplained bruises are all too common experiences. One way to avoid becoming a victim is to conduct an attendant background check. Background checks include a review of job performance and verification that the information provided to the family caregiver is accurate, and that the attendant can do the job that the caregiver needs to be done.
Some states, including California, are referred to as closed record states because most criminal records are not readily available to the public. Although this makes checking an attendant’s history more challenging than in other states, a background check can still be conducted.
Getting past information about a potential aide can take longer than some caregivers are able to wait. One of the best and quickest strategies is to check with formal and informal references, including talking with those who have employed the aide or who have seen them at work. Those with Internet access can very quickly confirm address, age, and name information.
Below are strategies for conducting a background check yourself, followed by options available if you hire others to perform these duties. Some caregivers may find that a combination of the two options works best.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/background-checking-resources-help/,Background Checking: Resources That Help,"Create a file for each candidate. At the interview, ask for the following information and use this information in your search:
Ask for three references and call them all. At least two of the references should be from former employers.
Talk with informal sources. Don’t hesitate to contact the “friend of a friend” who originally suggested the person.
Meet with the person either at your home or at a nearby restaurant or coffee shop. During the face-to-face meeting with a potential candidate, invite the care recipient to participate when appropriate. One family caregiver suggested that if the prospective attendant spoke only to her and ignored her mother-in-law, she knew the attendant wasn’t compassionate enough.
Ask to see a photo identification card such as a valid driver’s license or passport. Other valid forms of identification (ID) include: Department of Motor Vehicles ID card, Green card, Military ID card, Immigration card, Alien Registration card, or a valid out-of state Driver’s License. Write down the number on the ID card. If the attendant will be providing transportation, get proof of a clean driving record by calling the DMV and verify license, insurance, and car dependability. Don’t be afraid to ask for a test drive.
Record the attendant’s full name, birth date, address, and phone number, and Social Security number on the ID card. Ask for a current address and any other city and/or state where they have lived in the last ten to 15 years.
If the person claims to be licensed, check with the licensing body, e.g. the Board of Nursing.
Ask the aide to sign (1) a waiver of confidentiality allowing you to view their personal history information, and (2) a waiver allowing you to run a credit check. If the prospective attendant is not willing to sign a form allowing the families to review personal records, the attendant is probably not a suitable candidate for hire.
Use an online people search website (for example www.backgroundcheckgateway.com) to confirm the information the worker has provided to you is correct. One can pay $10 to $100 to research someone’s history, including criminal history, online. Just know that in California, all records are not available due to protections under state code. (See the California Penal Code 11105.3.) 
 ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/background-checking-resources-help/,Background Checking: Resources That Help,"Consider hiring an agency to conduct the background check, including checking criminal history records available through the California Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOJ will not release records to an individual family caregiver, only to a qualifying organization. Criminal records cannot be released without the applicant’s permission.
The attendant would be asked to undergo a fingerprint check and sign a release allowing their criminal record history to be searched.
Tip: With issues of fingerprinting and criminal records, family caregivers may feel uncomfortable requiring their potential care attendant to go through this process. It’s important to know that all home health and nursing home caregivers are required to go through a similar screening process. 
California law allows certain government and private organizations qualifying as an “applicant agency” to conduct criminal record background checks to help determine the suitability of a person applying for a license, employment, or as a volunteer working with children, the elderly, or the disabled. Qualifying organizations can include law enforcement agencies, public and private schools, nonprofit organizations, and in-home supportive care agencies.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/background-checking-resources-help/,Background Checking: Resources That Help,"Organizations providing skilled nursing services (i.e., services of a registered nurse or licensed vocational nurse) are required to be licensed as home health agencies in California. State law requires that home health agency employees, including registered nurses, licensed vocational nurses, and certified home health aides, have background checks as a part of their licensure or certification. Each of the bodies that regulates these license certified employees is notified of subsequent arrests.
Organizations that do not provide skilled nursing services, such as home care aide organizations, do not require licensure and therefore are not required to perform criminal background checks. Many organizations perform the checks anyway to ensure they are hiring qualified providers. Be sure to ask detailed questions about an agency background checking process. You can also ask the attendant to sign a waiver of confidentiality, so you can view background information.
Tip: California is called a “closed record state.” The California Penal Code 11105.3 restricts the distribution of criminal background checks. Records are released according to specific categories. For example, a background check on a person applying to be a police officer will include any arrest and/or conviction for life. A background check for a person applying as a home care aide, on the other hand, will include only arrests and/or convictions for the last three years.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/bathing-dementia/,Bathing (for dementia),"People with dementia are often resistant to bathing. They will claim they just showered, or that they will do it later, or outright refuse to bathe. Unless someone is incontinent, daily bathing is not necessary. Pick your battles—once or twice a week may be sufficient. Coupling bathing with an activity is sometimes helpful, e.g. going to the doctor or out to lunch or having a bowl of ice cream.
If someone is used to a shower, don’t try to convert him/her to a bath and if used to a bath, don’t start giving showers. A sponge bath during the week at the sink may be sufficient, if supervised by you. Use non-rinse soap products to make the process easier.
Allow person to get into the bathtub with only a little water in it, and fill it up after he/she is comfortable. If using a bathtub, be sure you feel comfortable in getting the person out of the bathtub at the end of the bath.
Fear of bathing may be related to a number of factors such as fear of falling, fear of the water, fear of being cold, loss of dignity in being naked in front of you, or feeling vulnerable in the coldness of a bathroom.
Make sure the bathroom is warm to initiate bathing. Have everything ready ahead of time, such as towels, shampoo, a chair to sit on when dressing, and clothes to put on after bathing. Consider a towel warmer and towel blanket to wrap the person in after bathing.
Use a pre-existing opportunity to start undressing, such as when someone is sitting on the toilet and has clothes partly off anyway. Or in the morning when changing out of sleeping clothes. However, sometimes you will be more successful if you wait until the afternoon when you might not have other things to do and you can approach bathing in a slower, calmer manner.
Install grab bars, non-skid mats, a shower bench, handheld shower head, or bath stool to reassure the person you are bathing, to make your job easier, and to allow for greater safety and independence.
Use shampoo/conditioner combinations so as to only have to rinse the hair once. Liquid soap can make it easier to apply soap and only needs one hand to apply.
Allow your loved one to do as much as possible for himself/herself. This increases dignity and independence. Giving step-by-step instructions can help. Any way you can provide privacy will help.
Adjust the water temperature. Someone with dementia may not sense whether the water is too hot or too cold. Monitor the temperature throughout the bathing process.
If the person you are bathing becomes agitated, have soothing music, sing a song together, or interact in a way so as to distract him/her from the fear. Even offering a favorite cookie can be a distraction.
Adjust shower pressure so it is as soft as possible. People with dementia might feel the “sting” of shower water as a threat.
Dry the person while they are seated so as to reduce fear of falling in the person as well as yourself. Pat dry instead of rubbing to protect delicate skin. From this position, it will be easier to start the dressing process.",dementia

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/behavior-issues/,Behavior Issues,"Individuals with dementia or other conditions may exhibit confusing or challenging behaviors at times. Here are tips and guidance for handling common concerns to help caregivers better understand what their loved ones may be feeling or trying to communicate.
Anxiety and agitation can sometimes be caused by bodily discomfort, such as pain, constipation, hunger, or uncomfortable clothes. Try figuring out what might be wrong. Ask your physician to evaluate for medical problems. Medications and lack of sleep can cause behavioral changes.
 Stay calm, as your anxiety will increase their anxiety.
 Change in surroundings or routine can be disorienting for someone with dementia. Reassurance is necessary when in a new situation or when things have changed, such as a caregiver, sleeping room, hospitalization, etc. Identify and acknowledge their feelings and let them know they are safe and you are with them.
 Many people with dementia become paranoid and feel threatened by everything from a stranger to a piece of mail. If they are having delusions or hallucinations, do not try to talk them out of them, but rather distract or place your hand on theirs to calm them.
 Time of day, time of meals, and time of events at home can all trigger behavioral issues. For people who sundown, late afternoon can be a challenge. Some people are better in the mornings, others later in the day. Plan activities around when the person is at his/her best.
 Going for a walk outside or a walk around the house will get the person moving, which is both a distraction and also helps to reduce anxiety.
 If an activity, such as dressing, is frustrating, help the person to finish the task, using soothing words of reassurance. Then engage him/her in a new activity in which he/she will be successful, for example, folding towels.
 Overstimulation, too much noise, the TV, or too many people can all cause agitation. Soothing music or familiar songs can sometimes help. Keep the environment as stress free as possible.
 Do not try to physically restrain someone who is upset unless there is an immediate safety concern. Stopping him/her will lead to escalation and puts you and them in danger.
 People with sleep disturbances should be evaluated by your neurologist and/or someone with expertise in handling sleep problems. Attend a support group to see what has worked for others. Remember: You need your sleep as well, so solving this problem is essential for your own well-being.
 Behavior issues are the way that the person you are caring for is using to try and communicate something to you. Do not take it personally—they are not doing it to get you. Look behind the behavior like a detective and try to figure out what is causing it.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/brain-tumor/,Brain Tumor,"A brain tumor is a collection of cells that multiply out of control within the brain. Also called a neoplasm, growth, mass, or lesion, a brain tumor is classified as either primary or secondary (metastatic) and can be benign or malignant.
Primary brain tumors develop and generally remain in the brain.
Secondary brain tumors, or metastatic brain tumors, are cancers that develop elsewhere in the body and spread to the brain. The most common cancers that spread to the brain are lung, breast, melanoma, colon, and kidney cancers.
Malignant brain tumors grow rapidly and compress and/or invade normal brain tissue.
Benign brain tumors generally do not grow rapidly. However, even benign tumors can be life-threatening, due to their location in the brain.
Being informed of the diagnosis of a brain tumor is difficult for families, but there are also reasons to be hopeful. Substantial progress had been made in the medical understanding of cancers in general, and advances in learning the biology of brain tumors is leading to more effective treatment. Many of these treatment options are discussed below.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/brain-tumor/,Brain Tumor,"According to the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS), an estimated 87,000 new cases of primary brain tumors are diagnosed in the U.S. each year. 30% of these tumors are malignant brain tumors. Primary malignant brain tumors represent 2.4 percent of all deaths due to cancer in the U.S. Nearly 70% of all primary brain tumors are benign and can be treated successfully. An additional 150,000 individuals are diagnosed with metastatic brain tumors each year. The frequency of metastatic brain tumors appears to be increasing: improvements in treating primary cancers elsewhere in the body allow people to live longer, but stray cancer cells can find their way to the brain. There are more than 100 types of brain tumors. Certain types of primary brain tumors most commonly occur in children, while others occur more frequently in adults. Adult brain tumors typically appear between the ages of 40 and 60 years, and occur slightly more often in men.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/brain-tumor/,Brain Tumor,"As tumor cells multiply within the brain, they can press against, irritate, and/or destroy normal brain tissue. As a result, brain tumors may cause symptoms such as:
headaches
seizures
speech problems
weakness
poor vision
pain or numbness
movement problems
paralysis
nausea or vomiting
Brain tumors may cause feelings of tiredness or fatigue. In addition, brain tumors can cause problems with memory, reading, and talking. The symptoms experienced are often related to the location of the tumor. Not everyone gets every symptom. About one-third of people with brain tumors have no symptoms at all.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/brain-tumor/,Brain Tumor,"Brain tumors are most often diagnosed when a patient has developed a symptom causing them to seek medical attention. Common symptoms at diagnosis include headaches, seizures, weakness, changes in speech, vision, thinking or personality. After a doctor exams the patient, the doctor orders an imaging test, such as a MRI. The imaging helps to visualize what is causing the symptom. The images show the exact size, location, and impact a lesion is having on the brain. The imaging tests do not provide a definitive diagnosis. If a tumor is suspected, a surgical procedure is recommended, if possible, to obtain a tissue sample in order to determine exactly what type of cells or tumor it is. It is from the tissue sample that a diagnosis is made.
Brain tumors may be diagnosed and evaluated using a combination of these different types of procedures:
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
Computerized tomography (CT)
Positron emission tomography (PET)
Biopsy
MRI, CT, and PET scanning are all ways to take pictures of the inside of the body. They do not require surgery. These procedures are discussed in more detail below.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) MRIs are recommended and the preferred method to image a tumor due to the high quality of the images produced. MRIs use an extremely strong magnet to produce images. With contrast-enhanced MRI, the patient is first injected with a dye that makes normal and tumor tissue display differently. If your loved one requires an MRI, be sure to tell the doctor of any history of allergies or drug reactions. Because the MRI uses a magnet, no metal can be brought into the room while the MRI is taking place. Patients who have pacemakers and/or metal implants cannot have an MRI.
Computerized tomography (CT) A CT scan may be used for patients who cannot undergo MRI because they have pacemakers, metal implants, allergies, or claustrophobia.
CT scan machines take multiple x-rays of small areas of the brain from different angles. The computer then combines the scans to make a detailed, three-dimensional image.
Because iodine may be used as a contrast agent to enhance the image, you should tell the doctor if your loved one has any allergies, diabetes, asthma, a heart condition, kidney problems, or thyroid conditions.
Positron emission tomography scan (PET) PET scans are sometimes used in addition to an MRI or CT to evaluate brain tumors. After receiving treatment for a brain tumor, PET scans can also be used to differentiate new tumor growth from scar tissue or necrosis (cells killed by radiation).
Biopsy  Biopsy is the surgical removal of a small piece of the tumor tissue with the specific intent to provide a diagnosis. The tissue is studied to confirm the type of tumor, and to help the healthcare team outline a treatment plan.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/brain-tumor/,Brain Tumor,"A range of options is considered in the treatment of brain tumors. Your healthcare team will design a plan to help treat the tumor and relieve any symptoms the brain tumor may be causing.
The following healthcare professionals may be part of the treatment team:
Neurologist: a doctor who specializes in the management of patients with diseases of the brain and other parts of the nervous system.
Neurosurgeon (or brain surgeon): a doctor who specializes in surgery of the brain and the rest of the nervous system.
Neuro-oncologist: a doctor who specializes in the management of patients with brain tumors and other nervous system tumors.
Neuropsychologist: a psychologist who specializes in how the brain works and the impact that damage to the brain has on the patient.
Radiation oncologist: a doctor who specializes in the management of cancer patients and treats them with radiation therapy.
Physical therapist: a healthcare provider who teaches and guides the patient through various exercises to prevent pain and restore physical function or help the patient to adapt to new physical limits.
Occupational therapist: a health care provider who help patients gain independence in taking care of themselves, by providing strategies and exercises to allow them to participate in their daily self care routines and roles.
Speech-language pathologist or speech therapist: a healthcare provider who specializes in the treatment of communication and swallowing problems.
Social worker: a healthcare provider who provides a wide range of services directly to persons with cancer and their families including access and connecting with resources, counseling, support, and education.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/brain-tumor/,Brain Tumor,"The first treatment of choice, depending on the location and size of the tumor, is surgical removal of as much of the lesion as possible (also called resection). Surgery can also reduce symptoms caused by swelling in the brain. Improvement in surgical techniques in recent years has made surgery much safer; however, surgery always has risks that you and your loved one should discuss with the oncologist and neurosurgeon.. In deciding whether surgery is right for your loved one, your doctor will consider the size, location, and type of the tumor, as well as the patient’s overall health, and medical history.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/brain-tumor/,Brain Tumor,"Radiation therapy is the use of painless x-rays which destroy tumor cells by making them unable to reproduce. Radiation may be used after surgery to prevent the tumor from coming back (recurrence) by destroying tumor cells that could not be completely removed. In cases where surgery is not an option, radiotherapy may be used instead of surgery to destroy tumor tissue or to relieve symptoms. Different types of radiotherapy are described below:
Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) delivers an even dose of radiation to the entire brain. Whole brain radiotherapy is used when cancer has metastasized to the brain and when several tumors are present. The advantages of whole brain radiotherapy are that it can treat large and small tumors, many tumors at the same time, and tumors deep in the brain that cannot be removed through surgery. Whole brain radiotherapy is often used to reduce the risk of tumor recurrence after surgery.
Conventional external beam radiation is the most common form of radiation therapy and used to treat primary brain tumors. It is more precise that WBRT. The beams are aimed at the tumor plus a small border of tissue around the tumor in order to spare healthy brain tissue. Conventional external beam radiation therapy is painless, and is typically given in 15-minute visits over several weeks.
Stereotactic radiosurgery is a more targeted form of radiation therapy, and is not actually surgery at all. It is called “radiosurgery” because it is so precise and focused. The equipment used for radiosurgery is generally referred to by its brand name, such as Gamma Knife®, XKnife®, or CyberKnifeTM. This form of therapy delivers a higher dose of radiation to a small tumor (usually 1.5 inches or less in diameter) in a single treatment session. Because this form of radiation targets the tumor more precisely, it is less likely to injure healthy tissue. It is often used to treat small metastatic tumors and small tumor recurrences. Stereotactic radiosurgery treats only tumors that can be detected on MRI or CT scans.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/brain-tumor/,Brain Tumor,"Chemotherapy is the use of special drugs to kill tumor cells. Some chemotherapy drugs are given by mouth; others are given by injection. In some cases, chemotherapy may need to be given without stopping over a long period of time. In this case, a pump or catheter may be placed underneath the skin to deliver the drugs.
There is a chemically protective layer around the brain called the blood-brain barrier. This barrier can prevent the drugs or chemotherapy given by mouth or injection from reaching the brain. To solve this problem, new ways of giving chemotherapy are being developed to deliver the drug directly to the tumor. One example of this is chemotherapy wafer implants that are surgically implanted in the tumor site and deliver treatment over time.
New drugs are also being developed that target specific abnormalities found in the tumor cells. Referred to as “targeted therapies,” this new generation of drugs forms the basis of personalized medicine by targeting the genes (proteins), receptors, and enzymes that are specific to the tumor cells. Targeted drugs work by blocking cell signals that make tumor cells grow or by sending signals for the tumor cells to destroy themselves .
Because chemotherapy can affect both healthy cells and tumor cells, side effects can occur. These vary depending on the type of drug and the individual.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/brain-tumor/,Brain Tumor,"Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that boosts the body’s own immune system to fight off or kill the cancer cells. There are several types of immunotherapy, including monoclonal antibodies and tumor-agnostic therapies, non-specific immunotherapies, oncolytic virus therapy, t-cell therapy, and cancer vaccines. Depending on the type of cancer cells causing the brain tumor, different types of immunotherapies may be recommended. There are several immunotherapies that are now approved to treat systemic cancers that may metastasize to the brain.
There are currently two FDA-approved immunotherapy options for primary brain and central nervous system cancers. They are targeted antibodies;
Bevacizumab (Avastin): a monoclonal antibiody that targets the VEGF/VEGFR pathway and inhibits tumor blood vessel growth. This drug is approved to treat recurrent glioblastoma.
Dinutuximab (Unituxin) : a monoclonal antibody that targets the GD2 pathway; approved for first-line treatment of high risk pediatric neuroblastoma.
Additional immunotherapies are being tested in clinical trials around the world.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/brain-tumor/,Brain Tumor,"Tumor Treating Fields (TTF) is a cancer therapy that uses electric fields tuned to specific frequencies to disrupt cell division, inhibiting tumor growth, and ultimately causing cell death. It has been approved by the FDA for treatment of glioblastoma. TTF require electrical power or a battery pack and involve the patient wearing a cap of “arrays”, which transmit the alternating electric fields across the tumor cells. Beyond minor skin irritation where the arrays are placed on the scalp, the therapy has no systemic side effects.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/brain-tumor/,Brain Tumor,"The following treatments can help with the symptoms of a brain tumor, such as headaches and nausea, although they will not actually help to remove the tumor or cure your loved one:
Steroids (Corticosteroids) Brain tumors often produce swelling and inflammation inside the skull. This can cause headaches, sleepiness, and other problems. Steroids (corticosteroids), usually dexamethasone, reduce the swelling quickly and can improve mental functioning. Most patients feel better with short-term steroid medications; however, some will need to take steroids for more than a few months to control symptoms. If your loved one takes steroids as part of the treatment plan, be sure to tell the doctor or nurse about any changes in their health that you may notice. Steroids can cause side effects such as weight gain, increased appetite, insomnia, and irritability. Also, your loved one should speak with the doctor if they decide to stop taking steroids as stopping suddenly can be dangerous.
Anti-seizure medications (Anticonvulsants) Medications may be given to help prevent seizures. These medications are called anti-seizure medications or anticonvulsants. There are several different anti-seizure medications available such as Keppra, Tegretol, Trileptal, Lamictal, Dilantin, Depakote, Neurontin, and phenobarbitol. If your loved one is taking an anti-seizure medication as part of the treatment plan and either it does not work or causes unpleasant side effects, the doctor can switch to a different medication.
Complementary therapies Your loved one’s medical treatment is carefully planned to control the disease and reduce the symptoms as much as possible. Many people seek out complementary therapies to help them feel better and cope with the stress of cancer. These therapies are not meant to replace the medical therapy, but may help your loved one to manage his or her symptoms. Complementary therapies for cancer may include stress management, relaxation and imagery training, meditation, group support, family counseling, nutrition, herbal medicine, massage, acupuncture, and education. Some cancer centers and hospitals offer these services for people with cancer, their families, and their caregivers.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/brain-tumor/,Brain Tumor,"Clinical trials are research studies to test new treatments. For cancer research, a clinical trial might focus on medication, surgery, radiotherapy, a new type of therapy, or some combination of these. Benefits of participating in clinical trials include:
Receiving care from a medical team that specializes in your illness
Being among the first to receive a promising new treatment
Helping doctors understand more about cancer treatment, thus helping future cancer patients
Some risks of participating in clinical trials include:
An experimental treatment may not be as good as standard care
The new treatment may not work for your loved one
Your loved one may be in the study group that does not receive the new treatment
Doctors are now investigating several treatments for brain tumors in clinical trials. Some new drugs are designed to increase the effectiveness of standard treatments, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Other new treatments are designed to change tumor cells, so that their growth is under control. There are many ways to find trials that might be appropriate for your loved one. Start by asking the doctor about what trials are available. Various organizations also provide lists of trials along with information about what is being tested, and where the trial is occurring. See the section below entitled Resources for information on how to contact these organizations. Be sure to check with your loved one’s health insurance provider to see whether the costs of participating in the clinical trial are covered.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/brain-tumor/,Brain Tumor,"After treatment, a patient’s health is monitored closely. An MRI, CT, or other type of imaging scan may be done every so often to see if the treatment is working. Frequent physical exams will help the doctor find out if the cancer has returned or if side effects are a problem. Be sure to report any recurrence of symptoms or other changes in your loved one’s health promptly to the doctor or nurse.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/brain-tumor/,Brain Tumor,"Q: What effects do brain tumors have on the mind, emotions, or personality? Brain tumors can indeed affect the mind, emotions, and/or personality. Problems with memory, speech, and/or concentration may occur. Your loved one may face serious mental challenges with feelings of confusion. Moods may change, as may the way a person acts. Your loved one may have difficulty doing more than one task at a time. Various treatments may slow the progression of these symptoms, so check with the doctor about what treatments may help.
Be aware that a neuropsychologist can help with rehabilitation. In order to come up with an effective plan, the neuropsychologist will first do a series of tests to look at your loved one’s emotions, behaviors, and mental abilities. Based on the results of the tests, one or more of the following may be recommended:
Cognitive rehabilitation, which means treatment for mental difficulties
Occupational rehabilitation, which is education and training about how to be able to continue working
Counseling to deal with emotional changes
Q: How can the home be safer for my loved one with brain tumors? Due to possible muscle weakness, changes in balance, and other considerations, the following may help make your home safer for your loved one:
Put handrails in shower and bathtub
Get a shower chair
If the home is more than one story, consider putting your loved one’s bed on the ground floor
Consider getting a hospital bed
Consider getting a portable toilet
Q: How can I cope emotionally? As a caregiver, you may choose to receive counseling to learn how to help your loved one deal with the mental changes they are having and most importantly how to deal with your own reactions to changes in your loved one. This is a difficult time for everyone involved. While illness may bring people closer together, it may also cause tension, unhappiness, and stress. Here are some suggestions for coping:
Find family members and friends who are willing to commit to helping you take care of your loved one.
Involve those people in a caring community that provides both practical and emotional support to you and your loved one.
Identify your strengths and the strengths of the others in your caring community.
Take time off regularly! Caregiver burnout is a major concern.

Unfortunately, very few programs pay family members or friends on a regular basis to provide care.
Medicare (government health insurance for people age 65 and older) does not pay for long-term care services, such as in-home care and adult day services, whether or not such services are provided by a direct care worker or a family member. Sometimes, however, caregiving families may obtain financial relief for specific purposes, such as for respite care or to purchase goods and services, and in some cases, pay for caregiving.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver-depression-silent-health-crisis/,Caregiver Depression: A Silent Health Crisis,"One of today’s all-too silent health crises is caregiver depression. A conservative estimate reports that 20% of family caregivers suffer from depression, twice the rate of the general population. Of clients of California’s Caregiver Resource Centers, nearly 60% show clinical signs of depression. And former caregivers may not escape the tentacles of this condition after caregiving ends. A recent study found that 41% of former caregivers of a spouse with Alzheimer’s disease or another form of dementia experienced mild to severe depression up to three years after their spouse had died. In general, women caregivers experience depression at a higher rate than men.
Caregiving does not cause depression, nor will everyone who provides care experience the negative feelings that go with depression. But in an effort to provide the best possible care for a family member or friend, caregivers often sacrifice their own physical and emotional needs, and the emotional and physical experiences involved with providing care can strain even the most capable person. The resulting feelings of anger, anxiety, sadness, isolation, exhaustion—and then guilt for having these feelings—can exact a heavy toll.
Unfortunately, feelings of depression are often seen as a sign of weakness rather than a sign that something is out of balance. Comments such as “snap out of it” or “it’s all in your head” are not helpful, and reflect a belief that mental health concerns are not real. Ignoring or denying your feelings will not make them go away.
People experience depression in different ways; the type and degree of symptoms vary by individual and can change over time. The following symptoms, if experienced for more than two consecutive weeks, may indicate depression:
A change in eating habits resulting in unwanted weight gain or loss
A change in sleep patterns—too much sleep or not enough
Feeling tired all the time
A loss of interest in people and/or activities that once brought you pleasure
Becoming easily agitated or angered
Feeling that nothing you do is good enough
Thoughts of death or suicide, or attempting suicide
Ongoing physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders, and chronic pain
Early attention to symptoms of depression may help to prevent the development of a more serious depression over time.",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver-depression-silent-health-crisis/,Caregiver Depression: A Silent Health Crisis,"Set realistic goals in light of the depression and assume a reasonable amount of responsibility.
Break large tasks into small ones, set some priorities, and do what you can as you can.
Try to be with other people and to confide in someone; it is usually better than being alone and secretive.
Participate in activities that may make you feel better, such as mild exercise, going to a movie or ballgame, or attending a religious, social, or community event.
Expect your mood to improve gradually, not immediately. Feeling better takes time.
It is advisable to postpone important decisions until the depression has lifted. Before deciding to make a significant transition—change jobs, get married, or divorced—discuss it with others who know you well and have a more objective view of your situation.
People rarely “snap out of” a depression. But they can feel a little better day by day.
Remember, positive thinking will replace the negative thinking that is part of the depression. The negative thinking will be reduced as your depression responds to treatment.
Let your family and friends help you.",depression

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver-health/,Caregiver Health,"An estimated 44 million Americans age 18 and older provide unpaid assistance and support to older people and adults with disabilities who live in the community.1 The value of this unpaid labor force is estimated to be at least $306 billion annually,2 nearly double the combined costs of home health care ($43 billion) and nursing home care ($115 billion).3
Evidence shows that most caregivers are ill-prepared for their role and provide care with little or no support,4, 5, 6 yet more than one-third of caregivers continue to provide intense care to others while suffering from poor health themselves.7 Studies have shown that an influential factor in a caregiver’s decision to place an impaired relative in a long-term care facility is the family caregiver’s own physical health.8, 9, 10, 11
A substantial body of research shows that family members who provide care to individuals with chronic or disabling conditions are themselves at risk. Emotional, mental, and physical health problems arise from complex caregiving situations and the strains of caring for frail or disabled relatives.
Today, medical advances, shorter hospital stays, limited discharge planning, and expansion of home care technology have placed increased costs as well as increased care responsibilities on families, who are being asked to shoulder greater care burdens for longer periods of time.12, 13 To make matters worse, caregivers are more likely to lack health insurance coverage due to time out of the workforce.14 These burdens and health risks can hinder the caregivers’ ability to provide care, lead to higher health care costs and affect the quality of life of both the caregiver and care receivers.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver-health/,Caregiver Health,"The psychological health of the family caregiver is negatively affected by providing care. Higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health effects are common among family members who care for an older relative or friend.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver-health/,Caregiver Health,"Studies consistently report higher levels of depressive symptoms and mental health problems among caregivers than among their noncaregiving peers.15, 16, 17, 18, 19
Estimates show that between 40 to 70% of caregivers have clinically significant symptoms of depression, with approximately one quarter to one half of these caregivers meeting the diagnostic criteria for major depression.20
Both caregiver depression and perceived burden increase as the care receiver’s functional status declines.21 Thus, higher levels of clinical depression are attributed to people caring for individuals with dementia. Studies show that 30 to 40% of dementia caregivers suffer from depression and emotional stress.22, 23
Depression and anxiety disorders found in caregivers persist and can even worsen after the placement of the patient in a nursing home. Many caregivers who institutionalize their relative report depressive symptoms and anxiety to be as high as it was when care was in the home.24
Depressed caregivers are more likely to have coexisting anxiety disorders, substance abuse or dependence, and chronic disease. Depression is also one of the most common conditions associated with suicide attempts.25",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver-health/,Caregiver Health,"Caregivers have higher levels of stress than noncaregivers.26 They also describe feeling frustrated, angry, drained, guilty or helpless as a result of providing care.27
Some 16% of caregivers feel emotionally strained and 26% say taking care of the care recipient is hard on them emotionally.28 An additional 13% of caregivers feel frustrated with the lack of progress made with the care recipient.29
Caregiving can also result in feeling a loss of self identity, lower levels of self esteem, constant worry, or feelings of uncertainty.30 Caregivers have less self-acceptance and feel less effective and less in control of their lives than noncaregivers.31, 32
More than one-fifth (22%) of caregivers are exhausted when they go to bed at night, and many feel they cannot handle all their caregiving responsibilities.33
Caregivers who experience chronic stress may be at greater risk for cognitive decline including loss in short-term memory, attention and verbal IQ.35 ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver-health/,Caregiver Health,"Research shows that female caregivers (who comprise about two-thirds of all unpaid caregivers)41,42 fare worse than their male counterparts, reporting higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms and lower levels of subjective well-being, life satisfaction, and physical health than male caregivers.43,44,45
According to one study, there is a dramatic increase in risk of mental health consequences among women who provide 36 or more hours per week of care to a spouse.46
In a national survey on caregiver health, more than one in five (21%) women surveyed had mammograms less often.47",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver-health/,Caregiver Health,"As a response to increased stress, caregivers are shown to have increased alcohol and other substance use. Several studies have shown that caregivers use prescription and psychotropic drugs more than noncaregivers.37, 38
Family caregivers are at greater risk for higher levels of hostility than noncaregivers.39
Spousal caregivers who are at risk of clinical depression and are caring for a spouse with significant cognitive impairment and/or physical care needs are more likely to engage in harmful behavior toward their loved one.40",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver-health/,Caregiver Health,"High rates of depressive symptoms and mental health problems among caregivers, compounded with the physical strain of caring for someone who cannot perform activities of daily living (ADLs), such as bathing, grooming and other personal care activities, put many caregivers at serious risk for poor physical health outcomes. Indeed, the impact of providing care can lead to increased health care needs for the caregiver.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver-health/,Caregiver Health,"About one in ten (11%) caregivers report that caregiving has caused their physical health to get worse.48
Caregivers have lower levels of subjective well-being and physical health than noncaregivers.49, 50 In 2005, three-fifths of caregivers reported fair or poor health status, one or more chronic conditions, or a disability, compared with one-third of noncaregivers.51 Caregivers also reported chronic conditions (including heart attack/heart disease, cancer, diabetes and arthritis) at nearly twice the rate of noncaregivers (45 vs. 24%).52
Caregivers suffer from increased rates of physical ailments (including acid reflux, headaches, and pain/aching),53 increased tendency to develop serious illness,54 and have high levels of obesity and bodily pain.55
Studies demonstrate that caregivers have diminished immune response, which leads to frequent infection and increased risk of cancers.56, 57, 58 For example, caregivers have a 23% higher level of stress hormones and a 15% lower level of antibody responses.59 Caregivers also suffer from slower wound healing.60
The physical stress of caregiving can affect the physical health of the caregiver, especially when providing care for someone who cannot transfer him/herself out of bed, walk or bathe without assistance. Ten percent of primary caregivers report that they are physically strained.61",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver-health/,Caregiver Health,"Caregivers exhibit exaggerated cardiovascular responses to stressful conditions which put them at greater risk than noncaregivers for the development of cardiovascular syndromes such as high blood pressure or heart disease.62, 63
Women providing care to an ill/disabled spouse are more likely to report a personal history of high blood pressure, diabetes and higher levels of cholesterol.64
Women who spend nine or more hours a week caring for an ill or disabled spouse increase their risk of heart disease two-fold.65",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver-health/,Caregiver Health,"Caregivers are less likely to engage in preventive health behaviors.66
Spousal caregivers who provide 36 or more hours per week of care are slightly more likely to smoke and consume more saturated fat.67
Compared to noncaregivers, women caregivers are twice as likely not to fill a prescription because of the cost (26% vs. 13%).68
Nearly three quarters (72%) of caregivers reported that they had not gone to the doctor as often as they should, and more than half (55%) had missed doctors appointments.69
Caregivers’ self-care suffers because they lack the time and energy to prepare proper meals or to exercise. About six in ten caregivers in a national survey reported that their eating (63%) and exercising (58%) habits are worse than before.70
Caregivers in rural areas are at a greater disadvantage for having their own medical needs met due to difficulty getting to the hospital and doctor.71",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver-health/,Caregiver Health,"Elderly spousal caregivers (aged 66-96) who experience caregiving-related stress have a 63% higher mortality rate than noncaregivers of the same age.72
In 2006, hospitalization of an elderly spouse was found to be associated with an increased risk of caregiver death.73",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver-health/,Caregiver Health,"A large and growing body of evidence reveals that providing care for a chronically sick person can have harmful physical, mental, and emotional consequences for the caregiver.74, 75, 76, 77 As families struggle to care for others, their own health is put in danger. As a result, caregiver health is quickly becoming a public health issue that requires more focused attention from health professionals, policy makers and caregivers themselves to ensure the health and safety of those individuals dedicating their lives to the care of others.
Increasing appropriate mental health services and medical care for family caregivers are important steps toward addressing caregiver health. Although caregiving can have a negative impact on caregivers’ health and well-being, research demonstrates its effects can be alleviated at least partially by:
An assessment of family caregiver needs that leads to a care plan with support services;78, 79
Caregiver education and support programs;80, 81, 82
Respite to reduce caregiver burden;83, 84, 85
Financial support to alleviate the economic stress of
caregiving; and
Primary care interventions that address caregiver needs.86, 87
Improved recognition and treatment of physical and psychological symptoms among caregivers is a growing health concern and should be considered a public health priority. Keeping family caregivers healthy and able to provide care is key to maintaining our nation’s long-term care system and, with the aging of the population, this issue will only grow more important in the coming decades.",[]

 Get support. Attend a support group, have a buddy you can call just to let off steam and complain. Depression is treatable. Talk to your doctor about it. Or seek counseling.
 Practice communication and behavior management skills if you are caring for someone with dementia. This will make your job easier. Learn how to do this by taking a class or researching online. The best communication strategies are often not intuitive.
 Relax. Read a book, meditate, pray, garden, knit, get a massage, take a long bath.
 Take care of your health. Go to the doctor, get routine exams and flu shots, get enough sleep, and eat your fruits and vegetables.
 Ask for and accept help when offered. No one can do this alone.
 Change “guilt” to “regret.” Guilt is you did something wrong, regret is that you are in a difficult situation and sometimes you have to make difficult decisions, but they are not wrong.
 Forgive yourself—often. You cannot be a perfect caregiver, all day, every day.
 Laugh. Find ways to keep your sense of humor on a daily basis. Watch comedies, practice laughter yoga, share jokes with friends.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregivers-guide-understanding-dementia-behaviors/,Caregiver’s Guide to Understanding Dementia Behaviors,"Caring for a loved one with dementia poses many challenges for families and caregivers. People with dementia from conditions such as Alzheimer’s and related diseases have a progressive biological brain disorder that makes it more and more difficult for them to remember things, think clearly, communicate with others, and take care of themselves. In addition, dementia can cause mood swings and even change a person’s personality and behavior. This fact sheet provides some practical strategies for dealing with the troubling behavior problems and communication difficulties often encountered when caring for a person with dementia.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregivers-guide-understanding-dementia-behaviors/,Caregiver’s Guide to Understanding Dementia Behaviors,"We aren’t born knowing how to communicate with a person with dementia—but we can learn. Improving your communication skills will help make caregiving less stressful and will likely improve the quality of your relationship with your loved one. Good communication skills will also enhance your ability to handle the difficult behavior you may encounter as you care for a person with a dementing illness.
Set a positive mood for interaction. Your attitude and body language communicate your feelings and thoughts more strongly than your words do. Set a positive mood by speaking to your loved one in a pleasant and respectful manner. Use facial expressions, tone of voice, and physical touch to help convey your message and show your feelings of affection.
Get the person’s attention. Limit distractions and noise—turn off the radio or TV, close the curtains or shut the door, or move to quieter surroundings. Before speaking, make sure you have her attention; address her by name, identify yourself by name and relation, and use nonverbal cues and touch to help keep her focused. If she is seated, get down to her level and maintain eye contact.
State your message clearly. Use simple words and sentences. Speak slowly, distinctly, and in a reassuring tone. Refrain from raising your voice higher or louder; instead, pitch your voice lower. If she doesn’t understand the first time, use the same wording to repeat your message or question. If she still doesn’t understand, wait a few minutes and rephrase the question. Use the names of people and places instead of pronouns (he, she, they) or abbreviations.
Ask simple, answerable questions. Ask one question at a time; those with yes or no answers work best. Refrain from asking open-ended questions or giving too many choices. For example, ask, “Would you like to wear your white shirt or your blue shirt?” Better still, show her the choices—visual prompts and cues also help clarify your question and can guide her response.
Listen with your ears, eyes, and heart. Be patient in waiting for your loved one’s reply. If she is struggling for an answer, it’s okay to suggest words. Watch for nonverbal cues and body language, and respond appropriately. Always strive to listen for the meaning and feelings that underlie the words.
Break down activities into a series of steps. This makes many tasks much more manageable. You can encourage your loved one to do what he can, gently remind him of steps he tends to forget, and assist with steps he’s no longer able to accomplish on his own. Using visual cues, such as showing him with your hand where to place the dinner plate, can be very helpful.
When the going gets tough, distract and redirect. If your loved one becomes upset or agitated, try changing the subject or the environment. For example, ask him for help or suggest going for a walk. It is important to connect with the person on a feeling level, before you redirect. You might say, “I see you’re feeling sad—I’m sorry you’re upset. Let’s go get something to eat.”
Respond with affection and reassurance. People with dementia often feel confused, anxious, and unsure of themselves. Further, they often get reality confused and may recall things that never really occurred. Avoid trying to convince them they are wrong. Stay focused on the feelings they are demonstrating (which are real) and respond with verbal and physical expressions of comfort, support, and reassurance. Sometimes holding hands, touching, hugging, and praise will get the person to respond when all else fails.
Remember the good old days. Remembering the past is often a soothing and affirming activity. Many people with dementia may not remember what happened 45 minutes ago, but they can clearly recall their lives 45 years earlier. Therefore, avoid asking questions that rely on short-term memory, such as asking the person what they had for lunch. Instead, try asking general questions about the person’s distant past—this information is more likely to be retained.
Maintain your sense of humor. Use humor whenever possible, though not at the person’s expense. People with dementia tend to retain their social skills and are usually delighted to laugh along with you.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregivers-guide-understanding-dementia-behaviors/,Caregiver’s Guide to Understanding Dementia Behaviors,"Some of the greatest challenges of caring for a loved one with dementia are the personality and behavior changes that often occur. You can best meet these challenges by using creativity, flexibility, patience, and compassion. It also helps to not take things personally and maintain your sense of humor.
To start, consider these ground rules:
We cannot change the person. The person you are caring for has a brain disorder that shapes who he has become. When you try to control or change his behavior, you’ll most likely be unsuccessful or be met with resistance. It’s important to:
Try to accommodate the behavior, not control the behavior. For example, if the person insists on sleeping on the floor, place a mattress on the floor to make him more comfortable.
Remember that we can change our behavior or the physical environment. Changing our own behavior will often result in a change in our loved one’s behavior.
Check with the doctor first. Behavioral problems may have an underlying medical reason: perhaps the person is in pain or experiencing an adverse side effect from medications. In some cases, like incontinence or hallucinations, there may be some medication or treatment that can assist in managing the problem.
Behavior has a purpose. People with dementia typically cannot tell us what they want or need. They might do something, like take all the clothes out of the closet on a daily basis, and we wonder why. It is very likely that the person is fulfilling a need to be busy and productive. Always consider what need the person might be trying to meet with their behavior—and, when possible, try to accommodate them.
Behavior is triggered. It is important to understand that all behavior is triggered—it occurs for a reason. It might be something a person did or said that triggered a behavior, or it could be a change in the physical environment. The root to changing behavior is disrupting the patterns that we create. Try a different approach, or try a different consequence.
What works today, may not tomorrow. The multiple factors that influence troubling behaviors, and the natural progression of the disease process, mean that solutions that are effective today may need to be modified tomorrow—or may no longer work at all. The key to managing difficult behaviors is being creative and flexible in your strategies to address a given issue.
Get support from others. You are not alone—there are many others caring for someone with dementia. Locate your nearest Area Agency on Aging, the local chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association, a California Caregiver Resource Center, or visit the Family Care Navigator (www.caregiver.org/family-care-navigator) to find support groups, organizations, and services that can help you. Expect that, like the loved one you are caring for, you will have good days and bad days. Develop strategies for coping with the bad days.
The following is an overview of the most common dementia-associated behaviors, with suggestions that may be useful in handling them. You’ll find additional resources listed at the end of this fact sheet.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregivers-guide-understanding-dementia-behaviors/,Caregiver’s Guide to Understanding Dementia Behaviors,"People with dementia walk seemingly aimlessly, for a variety of reasons, such as boredom, medication side effects, or to look for “something” or someone. They also may be trying to fulfill a physical need—thirst, hunger, a need to use the toilet, or exercise. Discovering the triggers for wandering are not always easy, but they can provide insights to dealing with the behavior.
Make time for regular exercise to minimize restlessness.
Consider installing new locks that require a key. Position locks high or low on the door; many people with dementia will not think to look beyond eye level. Keep in mind fire and safety concerns for all family members; the lock(s) must be accessible to others and not take more than a few seconds to open.
Try a barrier like a curtain or colored streamer to mask the door. A “stop” sign or “do not enter” sign also may help.
Place a black mat or paint a black space on your front porch; this may appear to be an impassable hole to the person with dementia.
Add “child-safe” plastic covers to doorknobs.
Consider installing a home security system or monitoring system designed to keep watch over someone with dementia. Also available are new digital devices that can be worn like a watch or clipped on a belt that use global positioning systems (GPS) or other technology to track a person’s whereabouts or locate him if he wanders off.
Put away essential items such as the confused person’s coat, purse, or glasses. Some individuals will not go out without certain articles.
Have your relative wear an ID bracelet and sew ID labels in their clothes. Always have a current photo available should you need to report your loved one missing. Consider leaving a copy on file at the police department or registering the person with the Alzheimer’s Association Safe Return program or other emergency tracking service.
Tell neighbors about your relative’s wandering behavior, and make sure they have your phone number.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregivers-guide-understanding-dementia-behaviors/,Caregiver’s Guide to Understanding Dementia Behaviors,"The loss of bladder or bowel control often occurs as dementia progresses. Sometimes accidents result from environmental factors; for example, someone can’t remember where the bathroom is located or can’t get to it in time. If an accident occurs, your understanding and reassurance will help the person maintain dignity and minimize embarrassment.
Establish a routine for using the toilet. Try reminding the person or assisting her to the bathroom every two hours.
Schedule fluid intake to ensure the confused person does not become dehydrated. Know that some drinks (coffee, tea, cola, or beer) have more of a diuretic effect than others. Limit fluid intake in the evening before bedtime.
Use signs (with illustrations) to indicate which door leads to the bathroom.
A commode, obtained at any medical supply store, can be left in the bedroom at night for easy access.
Incontinence pads and products can be purchased at the pharmacy or supermarket. A urologist may be able to prescribe a special product or treatment.
Use easy-to-remove clothing with elastic waistbands or velcro closures, and provide clothes that are easily washable.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregivers-guide-understanding-dementia-behaviors/,Caregiver’s Guide to Understanding Dementia Behaviors,"Agitation refers to a range of behaviors associated with dementia, including irritability, sleeplessness, and verbal or physical aggression. Often these types of behavior problems progress with the stages of dementia, from mild to more severe. Agitation may be triggered by a variety of things, including environmental factors, fear, and fatigue. Most often, agitation is triggered when the person experiences “control” being taken from him or her.
Reduce noise, clutter, or the number of persons in the room.
Maintain structure by keeping the same routines. Keep household objects and furniture in the same places. Familiar objects and photographs offer a sense of security and can suggest pleasant memories.
Reduce caffeine intake, sugar, and other foods that cause spikes in energy.
Try gentle touch, soothing music, reading, or walks to quell agitation. Speak in a reassuring voice. Do not try to restrain the person during a period of agitation.
Keep dangerous objects out of reach.
Allow the person to do as much for himself as possible—support his independence and ability to care for himself.
Acknowledge the confused person’s anger over the loss of control in his life. Tell him you understand his frustration.
Distract the person with a snack or an activity. Allow him to forget the troubling incident. Confronting a confused person may increase anxiety.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregivers-guide-understanding-dementia-behaviors/,Caregiver’s Guide to Understanding Dementia Behaviors,"People with dementia will often repeat a word, statement, question, or activity over and over. While this type of behavior is usually harmless for the person with dementia, it can be annoying and stressful to caregivers. Sometimes the behavior is triggered by anxiety, boredom, fear, or environmental factors.
Provide plenty of reassurance and comfort, both in words and in touch.
Try distracting with a snack or activity.
Avoid reminding them that they just asked the same question. Try ignoring the behavior or question, and instead try refocusing the person into an activity such as singing or “helping” you with a chore.
Don’t discuss plans with a confused person until immediately prior to an event.
You may want to try placing a sign on the kitchen table, such as, “Dinner is at 6:30” or “Lois comes home at 5:00” to remove anxiety and uncertainty about anticipated events.
Learn to recognize certain behaviors. An agitated state or pulling at clothing, for example, could indicate a need to use the bathroom.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregivers-guide-understanding-dementia-behaviors/,Caregiver’s Guide to Understanding Dementia Behaviors,"Seeing a loved one suddenly become suspicious, jealous, or accusatory is unsettling. Remember, what the person is experiencing is very real to them. It is best not to argue or disagree. This, too, is part of the dementia—try not to take it personally.
If the confused person suspects money is “missing,” allow her to keep small amounts of money in a pocket or handbag for easy inspection.
Help them look for the “missing” object and then distract them into another activity. Try to learn where the confused person’s favorite hiding places are for storing objects, which are frequently assumed to be “lost.” Avoid arguing.
Take time to explain to other family members and home-helpers that suspicious accusations are a part of the dementing illness.
Try nonverbal reassurances like a gentle touch or hug. Respond to the feeling behind the accusation and then reassure the person. You might try saying, “I see this frightens you; stay with me, I won’t let anything happen to you.”",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregivers-guide-understanding-dementia-behaviors/,Caregiver’s Guide to Understanding Dementia Behaviors,"Restlessness, agitation, disorientation, and other troubling behavior in people with dementia often get worse at the end of the day and sometimes continue throughout the night. Experts believe this behavior, commonly called sundowning, is caused by a combination of factors, such as exhaustion from the day’s events and changes in the person’s biological clock that confuse day and night.
Increase daytime activities, particularly physical exercise. Discourage inactivity and napping during the day.
Watch out for dietary culprits, such as sugar, caffeine, and some types of junk food. Eliminate or restrict these types of foods and beverages to early in the day. Plan smaller meals throughout the day, including a light meal, such as half a sandwich, before bedtime.
Plan for the afternoon and evening hours to be quiet and calm; however, structured, quiet activity is important. Perhaps take a stroll outdoors, play a simple card game, or listen to soothing music together.
Turning on lights well before sunset and closing the curtains at dusk will minimize shadows and may help diminish confusion. At minimum, keep a nightlight in the person’s room, hallway, and bathroom.
Make sure the house is safe: block off stairs with gates, lock the kitchen door and/or put away dangerous items.
As a last resort, consider talking to the doctor about medication to help the agitated person relax and sleep. Be aware that sleeping pills and tranquilizers may solve one problem and create another, such as sleeping at night but being more confused the next day.
It’s essential that you, the caregiver, get enough sleep. If your loved one’s nighttime activity keeps you awake, consider asking a friend or relative, or hiring someone, to take a turn so that you can get a good night’s sleep. Catnaps during the day also might help.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregivers-guide-understanding-dementia-behaviors/,Caregiver’s Guide to Understanding Dementia Behaviors,"Ensuring that your loved one is eating enough nutritious foods and drinking enough fluids is a challenge. People with dementia literally begin to forget that they need to eat and drink. Complicating the issue may be dental problems or medications that decrease appetite or make food taste “funny.” The consequences of poor nutrition are many, including weight loss, irritability, sleeplessness, bladder or bowel problems, and disorientation.
Make meal and snack times part of the daily routine and schedule them around the same time every day. Instead of three big meals, try five or six smaller ones.
Make mealtimes a special time. Try flowers or soft music. Turn off loud radio programs and the TV.
Eating independently should take precedence over eating neatly or with “proper” table manners. Finger foods support independence. Pre-cut and season the food. Try using a straw or a child’s “sippy cup” if holding a glass has become difficult. Provide assistance only when necessary and allow plenty of time for meals.
Sit down and eat with your loved one. Often they will mimic your actions, and it makes the meal more pleasant to share it with someone.
Prepare foods with your loved one in mind. If they have dentures or trouble chewing or swallowing, use soft foods or cut food into bite-size pieces.
If chewing and swallowing are issues, try gently moving the person’s chin in a chewing motion or lightly stroking their throat to encourage them to swallow.
If loss of weight is a problem, offer nutritious high-calorie snacks between meals. Breakfast foods high in carbohydrates are often preferred. On the other hand, if the problem is weight gain, keep high-calorie foods out of sight. Instead, keep handy fresh fruits, veggie trays, and other healthy low-calorie snacks.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregivers-guide-understanding-dementia-behaviors/,Caregiver’s Guide to Understanding Dementia Behaviors,"People with dementia often have difficulty remembering “good” hygiene, such as brushing teeth, toileting, bathing, and regularly changing their clothes. From childhood we are taught these are highly private and personal activities; to be undressed and cleaned by another can feel frightening, humiliating, and embarrassing. As a result, bathing often causes distress for both caregivers and their loved ones.
Think historically of your loved one’s hygiene routine — did she prefer baths or showers? Mornings or nights? Did she have her hair washed at the salon or do it herself? Was there a favorite scent, lotion, or powder she always used? Adopting—as much as possible—her past bathing routine may provide some comfort. Remember that it may not be necessary to bathe every day—sometimes twice a week is sufficient.
If your loved one has always been modest, enhance that feeling by making sure doors and curtains are closed. Whether in the shower or the bath, keep a towel over her front, lifting to wash as needed. Have towels and a robe or her clothes ready when she gets out.
Be mindful of the environment, such as the temperature of the room and water (older adults are more sensitive to heat and cold) and the adequacy of lighting. It’s a good idea to use safety features such as non-slip floor bath mats, grab-bars, and bath or shower seats. A hand-held shower might also be a good feature to install. Remember—people are often afraid of falling. Help them feel secure in the shower or tub.
Never leave a person with dementia unattended in the bath or shower. Have all the bath things you need laid out beforehand. If giving a bath, draw the bath water first. Reassure the person that the water is warm—perhaps pour a cup of water over her hands before she steps in.
If hair washing is a struggle, make it a separate activity. Or, use a dry shampoo.
If bathing in the tub or shower is consistently traumatic, a towel bath provides a soothing alternative. A bed bath has traditionally been used with only the most frail and bed-ridden patients, soaping up a bit at a time in their beds, rinsing off with a basin of water, and drying with towels. A growing number of nurses in and out of facilities, however, are beginning to recognize its value and a variation—the “towel bath”—for others as well, including people with dementia who find bathing in the tub or shower uncomfortable or unpleasant. The towel bath uses a large bath towel and washcloths dampened in a plastic bag of warm water and no-rinse soap. Large bath-blankets are used to keep the patient covered, dry and warm while the dampened towel and washcloths are massaged over the body. ",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregivers-guide-understanding-dementia-behaviors/,Caregiver’s Guide to Understanding Dementia Behaviors,"Dressing is difficult for most dementia patients. Choose loose-fitting, comfortable clothes with easy zippers or snaps and minimal buttons. Reduce the person’s choices by removing seldom-worn clothes from the closet. It’s common for people with dementia to continue layering on clothes even though they are fully dressed. To facilitate dressing and support independence, lay out one article of clothing at a time, in the order it is to be worn. Remove soiled clothes from the room. Don’t argue if the person insists on wearing the same thing again.
Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that others don’t) and delusions (false beliefs, such as someone is trying to hurt or kill another) may occur as the dementia progresses. State simply and calmly your perception of the situation, but avoid arguing or trying to convince the person that their perceptions are wrong. Keep rooms well-lit to decrease shadows, and offer reassurance and a simple explanation if the curtains move from circulating air, or if a loud noise such as a plane or siren is heard. Distractions may help. Depending on the severity of symptoms, you might consider medication.
Sexually inappropriate behavior, such as masturbating or undressing in public, lewd remarks, unreasonable sexual demands, even sexually aggressive behavior, may occur during the course of the illness. Remember, this behavior is caused by the disease. Develop an action plan to follow before the behavior occurs, i.e., what you will say and do if the behavior happens at home, around other relatives, friends, or paid caregivers. If you can, identify what triggers the behavior.
Verbal outbursts such as cursing, arguing, and threatening often are expressions of anger or stress. React by staying calm and reassuring. Validate your loved one’s feelings and then try to distract or redirect his attention to something else.
“Shadowing” is when a person with dementia imitates and follows the caregiver, or constantly talks, asks questions, and interrupts. Like sundowning, this behavior often occurs late in the day and can be irritating for caregivers. Comfort the person with verbal and physical reassurance. Distraction or redirection might also help. Giving your loved one a job such as folding laundry might help to make her feel needed and useful.
People with dementia may become uncooperative and resistant to daily activities such as bathing, dressing, and eating. Often this is a response to feeling out of control, rushed, afraid, or confused by what you are asking of them. Break each task into steps and, in a reassuring voice, explain each step before you do it. Allow plenty of time. Find ways to have them assist to their ability in the process, or follow with an activity that they can perform.
Even with these many potential challenges, it’s important to remember that these behaviors are often coping tactics for a person with deteriorating brain function. There’s no question that dealing with these behaviors can make caregiving especially challenging.",dementia

Brown University Long-term Care Quality Letter, 1995
Modern medicines have contributed to longer life spans, improved health, and vastly improved our overall quality of life. Medications are the most common treatment for many diseases and conditions seen in older people and persons with disabilities. Medicines now not only treat and cure diseases that were untreatable just a few years ago, they aid in the early diagnosis of disease; prevent life-threatening illnesses; relieve pain and suffering; and allow people with terminal illnesses to live more comfortably during their last days.
However, for older adults and people with disabilities, medications—prescription, over-the-counter, social drugs such as alcohol, and herbal remedies/alternative medicines—can be a double-edged sword. When not used appropriately, effectively, and safely, medications can have devastating consequences.
The changes that occur with aging and disability make people more likely to suffer medication-related problems (MRPs). Nevertheless, research has shown that medication-related problems are often preventable. Caregivers can play a key role in helping to identify when an actual or potential MRP is occurring. This assistance can help prevent the costly and unwanted negative consequences of medication use, such as admission to acute care hospitals, assisted living facilities, or nursing homes. About one quarter of all nursing home admissions are due at least in part to the inability to take medication correctly.
Research has shown that a high percentage of caregivers help their friends or relatives manage medications. Caregivers for people with Alzheimer’s disease and other memory impairments commonly report problems with getting their relative or friend to take medications on time, in the right amount, and as directed. In surveys, caregivers often report that their knowledge of their loved one’s medications—intended uses, directions for use, side effects, possible interactions—is greater than that of the care recipients themselves.
When patients, caregivers, doctors and pharmacists function as a team, medication-related problems can be avoided, contributing to better outcomes and improved daily functioning. This fact sheet serves as a caregiver’s guide to medication use and provides tips on what to do about the challenges of that use.",[]

Why is this medicine prescribed?
How does the medicine work in my body?
How can I expect to feel once I start taking this medicine?
How will I know that the medicine is working? Is there a typical time period after which my symptoms should improve?

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver%ca%bcs-guide-medications-and-aging/,Caregiverʼs Guide to Medications and Aging,"Older adults, people with disabilities, and caregivers may encounter challenges when taking medications. Resolving these problems can lead to much better results from medicines. Consumers and caregivers must alert their doctors and pharmacists to any difficulties they have taking medications, including the following:
Memory: Difficulty remembering to take medications. The pharmacist can provide a variety of special pill boxes or other aids that remind a caregiver and senior to take medications. The devices range from low-tech, such as simple containers with compartments labeled for meals and bedtime, to high-tech, such as containers that beep when it’s time for a dose, or a special bottle cap that counts openings of a prescription bottle to tell if the day’s doses have been taken. For those with severe memory impairments, caregivers are key to the proper administration of all medicines. In addition, some aging-related service organizations offer medication reminder telephone calls for older persons with memory problems.
Vision: Difficulty reading labels on prescription labels and over-the-counter products. Pharmacists may be able to provide prescription labels in large print. Health care providers and caregivers can read the information on over-the-counter products for consumers with vision impairment. Magnifying glasses may also be helpful.
Hearing: Difficulty hearing instructions from health care professionals. Ask doctors, nurses, and pharmacists to speak louder and/or write down important information relevant to the safe use of medications. Caregivers can also be “the ears” for seniors with hearing impairments.
Dexterity: Difficulty opening bottles, inability to break tablets, problems handling medicines such as eye drops, inhalers for asthma and other lung disease, and insulin injections. These problems are common for people with arthritis and certain types of disabilities. Large, easy-open bottle tops are available for prescription medicines. If a prescription dose is one-half tablet, the pharmacist can split the tablets for you. Caregivers are key to assisting with the administration of eye drops, inhaled medications, injections, and other dosage forms that require fine motor skills. Again, pharmacies can provide instruction sheets on administration of medicines.
Swallowing: Difficulty swallowing tablets or capsules. Many prescription and over-the-counter products are available in a variety of dosage forms such as a liquid, skin patch, or suppository, greatly reducing difficulties associated with swallowing. Ask your pharmacist about alternative dosage forms.
Scheduling logistics: Scheduling many different medications throughout the day. One of the greatest challenges for older persons and caregivers is working medication schedules into daily routines. Special pill boxes and other aids, described above, can help. It’s essential that older people and caregivers devise a plan for medication administration that fits their daily schedule. For example, meal times or bedtimes can be used as cues for scheduling medication if mealtimes and bedtimes are regularly scheduled. Doctors and pharmacists can assist in developing a plan to best suit your daily schedule.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver%ca%bcs-guide-medications-and-aging/,Caregiverʼs Guide to Medications and Aging,"One very common problem associated with medication use among older adults and many people with disabilities is the use of multiple medications at one time, also referred to as “polypharmacy.” Research has shown that the more medications a person takes, the greater the risk of experiencing a medication-related problem. For most older persons, multiple medication use is the norm. Many chronic conditions or diseases—diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson’s disease, arthritis, incontinence, high blood pressure, pulmonary disease, osteoporosis, Alzheimer’s disease—often require the use of multiple medications. The focus must be the appropriateness, effectiveness, and safety of all prescription and over-the-counter medications. Caregivers must ask questions about each medication, such as:
Is this medication really needed?
Is the medication the most appropriate for the medical condition being treated?
Will the medication be a problem with other medical conditions that are occurring at the same time?
Is the medication being prescribed at the right dose?
Does the medication interact with other medications?
Can the medication be taken correctly based on specific patient circumstances?
Some of the challenges faced by caregivers who must juggle multiple medications for their loved ones include keeping all the prescriptions filled, especially during weekends and holidays, and managing medications prescribed by multiple doctors. Planning ahead to refill prescriptions on time is essential; keeping an up-to-date medication record can inform doctors of all medicines prescribed by others. A “Caregiver’s Notebook”—a looseleaf binder maintained by a caregiver—is an ideal way to compile information on medical diagnoses, doctors’ appointments, questions, and medication history. Talk to your primary care provider (PCP) before making any medication changes.",[]

It’s important to keep in mind that medication effects can directly impact the daily functioning of older and disabled persons. These effects or “symptoms” of MRPs may include:
excessive drowsiness
confusion
depression
delirium
insomnia
Parkinson’s-like symptoms
incontinence
muscle weakness
loss of appetite
falls and fractures
changes in speech and memory.
When these symptoms appear, they should be considered “red flags” to caregivers that an MRP may be happening.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver%ca%bcs-guide-medications-and-aging/,Caregiverʼs Guide to Medications and Aging,"This medication-related problem occurs when a person has a medical condition that requires a new or additional medication, but none has been provided. Examples among the older and disabled population include pain and depression, which often go undiagnosed, undertreated, or untreated. These conditions are frequently assumed by some health care professionals to be a “normal part of aging.” Inadequate treatment for pain and depression can lead to declines in functioning and participation in social activities.
Seniors often do not discuss all their symptoms with their health care professionals; many health care professionals do not adequately assess for all possible diseases and conditions. Proper assessment by health care professionals is essential so that symptoms can be identified and proper treatment initiated. Seniors and their caregivers must also feel comfortable discussing their symptoms—no matter how sensitive—with health care professionals.",[]

In addition, if a patient receives combination therapy when a single drug would be equally effective, then the patient would be receiving unnecessary medication. Patients who are exposed to unnecessary medications may experience toxic effects.

Examples include inappropriate dosage form; a condition that is nonresponsive to the medication; medication is not indicated for the condition being treated; or a more effective medication is available. Patients and their caregivers must have a clear understanding of what to expect—and when to expect it—when taking medications. When the result is different, the doctor should be contacted to make him or her aware of the situation.",[]

Medication dosages are considered too low if a patient has an appropriate indication for a medication, is not experiencing any side effects from the medication, yet is not realizing the desired benefit. When the correct medication is prescribed and the dose is too low, the benefits of the medication can be minimal or none at all, and may result in serious unpleasant effects through poor treatment. Simply adjusting the dosage and/or dosage interval can improve the clinical outcomes. Again, patients and their caregivers must have a clear understanding of what to expect from their medications.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver%ca%bcs-guide-medications-and-aging/,Caregiverʼs Guide to Medications and Aging,"Perhaps the most common medication-related problem among older persons is when the correct medication is prescribed, but the dose is too high. This MRP frequently occurs in older people because the physical changes of aging can alter the way our bodies process and react to medications. For example, in the aging body, the liver and kidneys may not as easily remove medications. In addition, changes in the distribution of fat and muscle can make seniors more susceptible to adverse drug events.
These changes increase an older person’s sensitivity to a potential adverse effect. A “normal dose” of a medication can be an overdose for many older persons. Some medications, however, are used in the same doses for both older and younger adults. Medications that act on the central nervous system (CNS) are particularly problematic because older persons are extra sensitive to the adverse effects of these medications. Examples include antidepressants, sedatives, antipsychotics, and some blood pressure medications. Signs that a dose may be too high include dizziness, confusion, delirium, insomnia, Parkinson’s-like symptoms, loss of appetite, falls, and changes in memory.
If you believe a drug dose may be too low or too high, or you are concerned about any medication-related problem, contact your primary care provider (PCP) and pharmacist before adjusing the medication(s).",[]

the characteristics of the patient
an allergic reaction to the medication
an interaction with another medication or food
the incorrect administration of the medication
a medication dosage increased or decreased too rapidly
Drug interactions can produce uncomfortable or dangerous adverse effects. A very common drug interaction involves blood-thinning medications that can thin the blood even more when combined with aspirin and some other pain relievers. Before prescribing any new drug, the doctor should be aware of all the other drugs the patient may be taking.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver%ca%bcs-guide-medications-and-aging/,Caregiverʼs Guide to Medications and Aging,"For medications to be safe and effective, they must be taken at a particular dosage, at specified times, and for a specific period of time. There are many reasons why patients don’t receive medications as prescribed. A patient, for example, may perceive that the medication has caused or will cause some adverse event, is confused about why and how to take the medication, or finds it inconvenient to take the medication.
The high cost of medications and the limited coverage for prescription drugs in public and private health insurance are major causes people don’t take their medicines. The use of generic medications, if available, helps reduce out-of-pocket expenses. Many pharmaceutical companies provide free medications or special discounts to persons with low incomes. Call around for the lowest price; many pharmacies will match the prices of their competitors. Ask your doctor for samples.
Several states offer pharmaceutical assistance programs for low-income seniors who are not Medicaid-eligible. Pharmacists can assist seniors in obtaining medications through these programs. (Food stamps and rental assistance can also help by making additional money available for medications.) Medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit changes begun in 2006 may also provide assistance with certain medication costs to some older people.",[]

Companies that sell these products are not required to demonstrate their safety and effectiveness. Some herbal ingredients are not listed on the packaging or the listing may be incomplete or inaccurate, so you may not know what you are taking. Although some herbal and other natural products may be beneficial in some instances, they can have significant and sometimes unpredictable side effects. Many herbals also interact with prescription and over-the-counter medicines. For example, ginkgo biloba, frequently used for memory loss, may interact with blood thinners, high blood pressure medications, and certain pain relievers such as ibuprofen and naproxen.

Include prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, other nutritional products, and herbal remedies on the list. Share the lists with your doctors or the doctors of the person you are caring for.
Some caregivers have to prepare and administer injectable medicines, such as insulin. Injections involve the use of a syringe and needle, which may be inserted under the skin or into a vein or muscle. Be certain that you understand and are comfortable with preparing the proper dosage and administering the injection. Nurses in doctors offices and pharmacists can and should instruct you on the proper techniques for injectable medicines.
Store all of your medications in a designated location in your home. Keep all medications stored together in one place unless they require refrigeration or are labeled “store in a cool place.” This will help if an emergency situation occurs and your doctor needs to review all your medications.
Be sure that your medications are stored out of reach of any children that may visit, especially if you have non-child proof containers. If you are caring for someone with cognitive or memory problems, be sure all medications are safely stored away.
Do not mix different medications together in one container; this will make it difficult if not impossible to identify your medications in an emergency.
Medicines should be stored in a cool, dry area. Do not store your medications in the medicine cabinet in the bathroom or in the kitchen because heat and moisture cause deterioration. Instead, store your medications in a designated area in your bedroom, dining room, or living room.
Medications stored in the refrigerator should be separated from other items in the refrigerator. Consider keeping refrigerated medications in a plastic box or container in one consistent location in the refrigerator.
Medications taken by mouth should be kept separate from other items that are for external use only, such as creams and ointments.
Expired medications (there are expiration dates on all of your medications) and any medication that your doctor has discontinued should be discarded.
Never share or give your medications to another person.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiver%ca%bcs-guide-medications-and-aging/,Caregiverʼs Guide to Medications and Aging,"The scope and severity of problems that can occur with medication therapy are tremendous. To prevent these problems from occurring, consumers and caregivers, as well as their health care professionals, have a responsibility to ensure appropriate, safe, and effective medication use. All professionals involved in prescribing and dispensing—as well as the consumer and caregiver—should consider themselves essential members of the health care team. The consumer or caregiver who alerts their doctor or nurse to the need for changes to medication therapy plays a vital role in getting the best treatment.
Consumer and caregiver responsibilities center on effective communication with the health care team. This includes presenting actual or potential medication-related problems in a timely manner to health care professionals, and participating in resolution of the problems. Before this can happen, consumers and caregivers must be able to recognize the possible signs and symptoms of a medication-related problem. For older adults, any symptom should be considered a medication-related problem until proved otherwise. When symptoms interfere with daily functioning and when the time sequence of the symptom indicates that it was caused by a medication, then a health care professional should be informed immediately.
Consumers and caregivers share responsibilities by expressing their concerns, expectations, and any lack of understanding about medication therapy, and demanding answers to their questions. Consumers need to be able to present health care professionals with accurate and complete information about health conditions. It is important for consumers with new medical problems to fully describe the problem, indicate how long it has been a problem, if the problem has been experienced before, how it started, what was done to relieve it, and what worked or didn’t work. For seniors with cognitive impairments, caregivers play a vital role in recognizing changes in health conditions and effectively describing problems to health care professionals. ",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving/,Caregiving,"Caregiving takes many forms. Many of us help older, sick, or disabled family members and friends every day. We know we are helping, but we don’t think of ourselves as caregivers. We are glad to do this and feel rewarded by it, but if the demands are heavy, over time we can also become exhausted and stressed. We think we should be able to handle caregiving roles on top of busy work and family schedules and begin to feel guilty and depressed as our stamina wanes.
About 44 million Americans provide 37 billion hours of unpaid, “informal” care each year for adult family members and friends with chronic illnesses or conditions that prevent them from handling daily activities such as bathing, managing medications or preparing meals on their own. Family caregivers, particularly women, provide over 75% of caregiving support in the United States. In 2007, the estimated economic value of family caregivers’ unpaid contributions was at least $375 billion, which is how much it would cost to replace that care with paid services.1",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving/,Caregiving,"The short answer is most of us, at some point in our lives. Caregivers are daughters, wives, husbands, sons, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, partners and friends. While some people receive care from paid caregivers, most rely on unpaid assistance from families, friends and neighbors.
Caregivers manage a wide range of responsibilities. In your family, for example, are you the person who:
Buys groceries, cooks, cleans house or does laundry for someone who needs special help doing these things?
Helps a family member get dressed, take a shower and take medicine?
Helps with transferring someone in and out of bed, helps with physical therapy, injections, feeding tubes or other medical procedures?
Makes medical appointments and drives to the doctor and drugstore?
Talks with the doctors, care managers and others to understand what needs to be done?
Spends time at work handling a crisis or making plans to help a family member who is sick?
Is the designated “on-call” family member for problems?
In small doses, these jobs are manageable. But having to juggle competing caregiving demands with the demands of your own life on an ongoing basis can be quite a challenge.
With the 65+ age group expected to double to 70 million people by 2030,2 family caregivers increasingly provide care for aging parents, siblings, and friends, most of whom have one or more chronic conditions3 and who wish to remain in their own homes and communities as they age.4 Others belong to the “sandwich generation,” caring for children and parents at the same time.
Caregiving roles and demands are impacted by a number of other factors, including:
Type of illness. Caring for someone with Alzheimer’s disease, other dementias, or other brain-impairing disorders can be more stressful than caring for someone with a physical impairment. Caring for someone with a cognitive disorder can be a 24/7 job due to the unpredictability of the care recipient’s behavior.5
Long-distance caregiving. Long-distance caregiving is usually defined as care provided by a caregiver living more than an hour away from the care recipient. Caring from a distance is difficult both emotionally and logistically, and is most common in situations where adult children and their parents do not live in the same area. In these cases, the caregiver’s role is not as much “hands-on” as it is gathering information about available resources, coordinating services and putting together a “team” of family, friends and paid help that can meet the care recipient’s needs.
Urban versus rural settings. Caregivers living in rural settings face unique challenges. These include fewer available formal services, fewer physicians and health education services, transportation difficulties, weather problems in winter, geographic distance and isolation.6
Different cultural approaches to caregiving. The United States’ great diversity means that families bring their own histories, traditions and rituals to caregiving. In many cultures, there are family expectations about the caregiving roles of adult children; this is especially true in cultures where daughters or daughters-in-law are expected to assume the primary caregiver role for aging parents.
For some people, caregiving occurs gradually over time. For others, it can happen overnight. Caregivers may be full- or part-time; live with their loved one or provide care from a distance. Caregivers provide a wide range of services, from simple help such as grocery shopping, to complex medical procedures. For the most part, friends, neighbors, and most of all, families, provide–without pay–the vast majority of healthcare in this country.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving/,Caregiving,"It is easy to become overwhelmed as a new caregiver. Five steps that can help are:
Start with a diagnosis. Learning about a family member’s diagnosis helps caregivers understand the disease process and plan ahead realistically.
Talk about finances and healthcare wishes. Having these conversations can be difficult, but completing Durable Powers of Attorney for finances and healthcare can help relieve anxiety and better prepare for the future.
Consider inviting family and close friends to come together and discuss the care needed. If possible, it’s helpful to include the care recipient in this meeting. This meeting gives caregivers a chance to say what they need, plan for care and ask others for assistance.
Take advantage of community resources such as Meals on Wheels and adult day programs. These resources help relieve the workload and offer a break. Look for caregiver educational programs that will increase knowledge and confidence.
Find support. The most important thing is for caregivers to not become isolated as they take on more responsibility and as social life moves into the background. Online and in-person groups can be very helpful in connecting with others in the same circumstances.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving/,Caregiving,"Data from many studies and reports reveal the following information about caregivers:
The “typical” U.S. caregiver is a 46-year-old woman who works outside the home and spends more than 20 hours per week providing unpaid care to her mother.7 Most caregivers are married or living with a partner.8
While caregivers can be found across the age span, the majority of caregivers are middle-aged (35-64 years old).9
Most caregivers are employed. Among caregivers age 50-64 years old, an estimated 60% are working full or part-time.10
Studies show that ethnic minority caregivers provide more care than their white counter-parts11 and report worse physical health than white caregivers.12
Many caregivers of older people are themselves elderly. Of those caring for someone aged 65+, the average age of caregivers is 63 years with one third of these caregivers in fair to poor health.13
Nearly half of caregivers provide fewer than eight hours of care per week, while nearly one in five provide more than 40 hours of care per week.14 A statewide California study of caregivers of adults with cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer’s showed that caregivers provided an average of 84 hours of care per week, the equivalent of more than two full-time jobs.15 Older caregivers often spend the most hours providing care16 and the amount of time spent caring increases substantially as cognitive impairment worsens.17
Caregiving can last from less than a year to more than 40 years. In a 2003 study, caregivers were found to spend an average of 4.3 years providing care. Older caregivers (50+) are more likely to have been caregiving for more than 10 years (17%).18
Most caregivers live near the people they care for. Eighty-three percent of caregivers care for relatives, with 24% living with the care recipient, 61% living up to one hour away, and 15%—or about 7,000,000 caregivers—living a one- to two- hour drive or more away.19",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving/,Caregiving,"Recent medical advances, shorter hospital stays, increasing life spans with better management of chronic illnesses, limited discharge planning, a shortage of homecare workers, and the expansion of home care technology have increased the caregiving responsibilities of families. Family caregivers are being asked to shoulder greater burdens for longer periods of time. In addition to more complex care, conflicting demands of jobs and family, increasing economic pressure, and the physical and emotional demands of long-term caregiving can result in major health impacts on caregivers.20
Over all, caregivers who experience the greatest emotional stress tend to be female. They are at risk for high levels of stress, frustration, anxiety, exhaustion and anger, depression, increased use of alcohol or other substances, reduced immune response, poor physical health and more chronic conditions, neglecting their own care and have higher mortality rates compared to noncaregivers.21
In addition, most caregivers are ill-prepared for their role and provide care with little or no support;22 yet more than one-third of caregivers continue to provide intense care to others while suffering from poor health themselves.23 An influential factor in a caregiver’s decision to place an impaired relative in a long-term care facility is the family caregiver’s own physical health.24",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving/,Caregiving,"Long term caregiving has significant financial consequences for caregivers, particularly for women. Informal caregivers personally lose about $659,139 over a lifetime: $25,494 in Social Security benefits; $67,202 in pension benefits; and $566,443 in forgone wages.
Caregivers face the loss of income of the care recipient, loss of their own income if they reduce their work hours or leave their jobs, loss of employer-based medical benefits, shrinking of savings to pay caregiving costs, and a threat to their retirement income due to fewer contributions to pensions and other retirement vehicles.25",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving/,Caregiving,"Caregiving also has a substantial impact on business. Lost productivity due to informal caregiving costs businesses $17.1 billion annually.26 Absenteeism, replacing employees who quit in order to provide care and other caregiving-related activities also have serious financial consequences to employers. For instance
The cost to businesses to replace women caregivers who quit their jobs because of their caregiving responsibilities has been estimated at $3.3 billion.
Absenteeism among women caregivers due to caregiving responsibilities costs businesses almost $270 million.
The cost to businesses because of partial absenteeism (e.g., extended lunch breaks, leaving work early or arriving late) due to women’s caregiving has been estimated at $327 million. Caregiving-related workday interruptions add another $3.8 billion to the burden borne by businesses.27
Working caregivers often suffer many work-related difficulties due to their “second careers” as caregivers. Sixty-seven percent of family caregivers report conflicts between caregiving and employment, resulting in reduced work hours or unpaid leave.28
The importance of eldercare is now recognized by a growing number of employers, with movement toward more flexible work schedules, “cafeteria style” benefits, in-house support groups, and education, information, and referrals provided through employee assistance programs.
Policy changes have also supported family caregivers. Companies with 50 or more employees must comply with the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a seriously ill parent, spouse or child, while protecting job security. Smaller firms can use the FMLA guidelines to provide support for individual employees. Paid Family Leave (PFL) provides workers with a maximum of six weeks of partial pay each year while taking time off from work to care for a seriously ill parent, child, spouse or registered domestic partner, and has been instituted in several states, including California. Policy changes that could also benefit family caregivers include paid sick leave that can be used by employees for themselves or to care for family members and expanding FMLA beyond immediate family members to include care for siblings, in-laws and grandparents.29",[]

Typical concerns include who will manage the confused person’s money, who will make important health care decisions and how to plan for long-term care.
An attorney can help plan for the financial aspects of long-term care needs, assist with surrogate decision-making tools such as the durable power of attorney (DPA) and a durable power of attorney for health care (DPAHC), and provide guidance in obtaining a conservatorship should the care recipient lack the capacity to make decisions. A conservatorship provides the legal authority to manage a person’s finances, estate, personal affairs, assets and medical care.30",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving/,Caregiving,"Because of the multi-faceted role that family and informal caregivers play, they need a range of support services to remain healthy, improve their caregiving skills and remain in their caregiving role. Support services include information, assistance, counseling, respite, home modifications or assistive devices, caregiver and family counseling, and support groups. While many services are available through local government agencies, service organizations, or faith-based organizations, employers’ programs also can mitigate the impact that caregiving can have on workers.
Services that improve caregiver depression, anxiety and anger benefit both the caregiver and the care recipient.31 Evidence also shows that caregiver support delays or prevents nursing home placement; people with moderate dementia have been able to defer placement by nearly 1.5 years when their family members receive caregiver services, including counseling, information and ongoing support.32",[]

Yet, the enormous pressures and risks of family caregiving—burnout, compromised health, depression and depletion of financial resources—are a reality of daily life for millions of American families and pose great strain on family caregivers, many of whom are struggling to balance work and family responsibilities.
Families need information and their own support services to preserve their critical role as caregivers, but frequently they do not know where to turn for help. When they do seek assistance, many community agencies cannot provide adequate supports due to funding constraints and out-dated policies. The federal government can help by taking steps to ensure that all family caregivers have access to caregiver assistance and to practical, high quality, and affordable home and community-based services. These are tough economic times, but supporting family caregivers is one of the most cost-effective long-term care investments we can make. As long as caregivers are able to provide care, they are often able to delay costly nursing home placements and reduce reliance on programs like Medicaid.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-101-being-caregiver/,Caregiving 101: On Being a Caregiver,"Caregiving often creeps up on you. You start by dropping by your mom’s house and doing her laundry, or taking your dad to a doctor’s appointment. You find yourself doing the grocery shopping and refilling prescriptions. Gradually, you are doing more and more. At some point, you realize you have made a commitment to take care of someone else.
Sometimes, caregiving is triggered by a major health event, such as a stroke, heart attack, or accident. Maybe you suddenly realize that dad’s memory lapses have become dangerous. Life as you know it stops, and all your energy goes to caring for your loved one. Caregiving has become your new career, and you adjust to a new normal.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-101-being-caregiver/,Caregiving 101: On Being a Caregiver,"Caregivers can be spouses, partners, adult children, parents, other relatives (siblings, aunts, nieces/nephews, in-laws, grandchildren), friends, neighbors. Whatever your relationship with the person you’re caring for, it’s important that you add the title caregiver to the list of things you are. Without identifying yourself as a caregiver, you won’t know to search for resources that can help you navigate this new role.
 
But caregivers play other roles as well. You may be employed full or part-time. You may be raising children, or be a volunteer, a spouse, have other family commitments. Adding caregiving to that list can easily lead to frustration and exhaustion. You might need to navigate social service systems, call doctors while you’re at work, advocate for the care receiver, and take care of their day-to-day needs, while you try to do all of those same things for yourself and your family.
You are rarely trained to do the broad range of tasks you are asked to do as a caregiver. As a result, you may end up, for example, with back strain because you haven’t had the benefit of training from a physical therapist on how to correctly transfer someone from bed to chair, or wheelchair to car. Or you find yourself battling with your mother who has Alzheimer’s because you have not learned the skills necessary to communicate with someone with a cognitive impairment.
Here are some of the common tasks caregivers do:
Buy groceries, cook, clean house, do laundry, provide transportation
Help the care receiver get dressed, take a shower, take medicine
Transfer someone out of bed/chair, help with physical therapy, perform medical interventions—injections, feeding tubes, wound treatment, breathing treatments
Arrange medical appointments, drive to the doctor, sit in during appointments, monitor medications
Talk with doctors, nurses, care managers, and others to understand what needs to be done
Spend time handling crises and arranging for assistance—especially for someone who cannot be left alone
Handle finances and other legal matters
Be a companion
Be a (usually) unpaid aide, on call 24/7
What are all the things you do? Try making a list, both for your own clarification and for other family members who may not be aware of your efforts.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-101-being-caregiver/,Caregiving 101: On Being a Caregiver,"It’s easy to become overwhelmed as a new caregiver. Here are some steps that can help:
Identify yourself as a caregiver
Get a good diagnosis—from a specialist or geriatrician if necessary—of your loved one’s health condition
Learn what specific skills you might need to care for someone with this diagnosis (Caring for someone with Frontotemporal dementia, for example, is different from caring for someone with chronic heart disease)
Talk about finances and healthcare wishes
Complete legal paperwork, e.g., Powers of Attorney, Advance Directives
Bring family and friends together to discuss care
Keep them up to date on the current situation
Identify resources, both personal and in the community
Find support for yourself and your loved one
Remember, you are not alone",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-101-being-caregiver/,Caregiving 101: On Being a Caregiver,"It‘s one thing to gear up for a short-term crisis. But it takes different skills to provide care over a longer period of time. You’ll be more successful if you learn to take care of yourself, starting immediately. Some things to remember:
You cannot be perfect
You have a right to all of your emotions (See FCA Fact Sheet Emotional Side of Caregiving.)
Depression is the most common emotion of long-term caregivers
Set realistic expectations—for yourself and your loved one
Learn about the disease and what you can expect
Learn the skills you need to care for the care receiver and which ones you are or are not able to perform
Learn to say “no” to things you cannot do
Learn to accept help from others
Build resilience
Identify your button-pushers/stressors
Identify your coping skills
Remember the big three for successful coping:
Eat right—good nutrition as opposed to stress-snacking. Limit alcohol and other drugs
Exercise—it may be hard to find time but it’s the best cure for depression and increases your endorphins (“good” coping hormones)
Sleep—7-8 hours is hard to get, but essential. Admit when you are experiencing burnout and get help

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-101-being-caregiver/,Caregiving 101: On Being a Caregiver,"The first stages of caregiving are the most challenging. This is when you are least informed about what’s needed and expected, and when you feel the most insecure and uncertain.
In addition to information about the disease/disability your loved one is dealing with, you need to understand his or her medications and medical interventions. (See FCA Fact Sheet Caregivers Guide to Medications and Aging.)
What knowledge/skills will you need to be able to care for him or her? Where can you get trained to do the tasks required? How can you learn to successfully:
Feed, bathe, groom, or dress someone?
Handle toileting or deal with incontinence?
 Handle a complicated medication schedule?
Transfer someone or help them walk?

You can find help in most communities for transportation, home delivered meals, day care programs, home repairs, and more. To learn about them, contact your local Area Agency on Aging (AAA) and find out what’s available locally—not only for your loved one, but also for yourself. (In many communities, AAAs can be reached by dialing 211). There may be benefits that you haven’t thought about—ask about Title IIIE funding, part of the Older Americans Act specifically for caregivers. There may be Veterans benefits. Other benefits can be found at Eldercare Locator, or FCA’s Family Care Navigator.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-101-being-caregiver/,Caregiving 101: On Being a Caregiver,"Caregiving is often a 24/7 job, and everyone needs a break sometimes. Getting away can give you perspective and remind you that there’s a world outside. Taking a respite break from caregiving can give you a chance to connect with others, share, laugh, catch up, renew. But it can also be a time for just doing things that are relaxing for you, such as reading a book without interruption, taking a nap, or going for a walk. This break is a necessary step in taking care of yourself so that you can care for someone else.
Respite can take many forms, from going away on a mini-vacation, to having someone in your home for a few hours so you can run errands or get to the doctor yourself. A local adult day care program may offer enough hours of care—including transportation—so that you can go to work or attend to your other needs and interests. Some residential facilities also offer temporary respite. There may be funds available through your Area Agency on Aging as well as organizations in your community that can help you to get the break you need (also available through the Veteran’s Administration for those eligible). Faith communities, disease-specific organizations and your network of friends might be able to help.
At first, it may not feel easy to take a respite break. First, there is our own internal reluctance to leave a loved one, particularly if he or she feels abandoned if you leave. Or there is the fear that something will happen while you’re away and only you know how to care for him or her correctly. You might feel guilty and not be sure you have the right to have a good time if your loved one is suffering. You may be concerned about the cost. But remember, you must care for yourself, too.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-101-being-caregiver/,Caregiving 101: On Being a Caregiver,"You can’t do it alone! And, like respite, getting support for your caregiving situation will help you take better care of yourself. The longer you are a caregiver, the more isolated you can become. How many times can you say, “I can’t get together with you” before people stop calling? But this lack of social interaction will lead to poorer health for you. One reason caregivers don’t get the help they need is that taking care of yourself feels like just “one more thing you have to do.”
But we all need someone to talk to. Special caregiver support groups in your community or online can help to reduce the feeling that you’re all alone and help you learn coping skills from others who are in similar situations. (See FCA Fact Sheet Taking Care of YOU: Self-Care for Family Caregivers.)
Adding stress to an already difficult situation, caregiving can also create family discord, particularly if you feel you’re not getting the help and support you need from members of your own family. Resentment can build on all sides. If you are dealing with family conflict, it might help to have a meeting. (See FCA Fact Sheets Holding a Family Meeting and Caregiving with Your Siblings.)
 ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-101-being-caregiver/,Caregiving 101: On Being a Caregiver,"Most of us find it hard to ask for help. About 50% of caregivers get no outside help at all. When someone asks if there’s anything they can do to help, most of us usually say, “Oh no, that’s OK, we’re doing fine.” When you’re a caregiver, it can be even harder. Whom can you call and what can you ask them to do? Learning to accept help early in your transition to being a caregiver will make it easier down the road.
Little things on a regular basis can mean a lot. Maybe someone would bring an occasional meal or dessert. Having someone help with household chores can be an opportunity to socialize as well as get things done. Maybe someone can just come and sit with your loved one so you can run to the grocery store. Make a list of things that you need help with. Post it on the refrigerator. If someone asks to help, show them the list and let them pick something they’d like to do. That way they’re more likely to enjoy the task. If you know a friend enjoys cooking but dislikes driving, your chances of getting help improve if you ask for help with meal prep instead of a ride to an appointment.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-101-being-caregiver/,Caregiving 101: On Being a Caregiver,"Caregiving has many challenges and also many rewards. But you need to honor your own needs as well as commit to caring for someone else. That’s the only way you will be able to sustain your patience and your caring and be successful over time. There are many things to learn and most caregivers are just “making it up” as they go along. Getting information and training will help you feel confident about the many tasks you perform. Information is available online, at disease-specific websites, at Family Caregiver Alliance, through your medical providers, Area Agencies on Aging, some employee assistance programs, support groups, senior centers, and your community. Start with saying “I am a caregiver and I need help.”",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-and-ambiguous-loss/,Caregiving and Ambiguous Loss,"Caregiving for a loved one can cause stress in many ways. To manage the stress—which we know can be dangerous to a caregiver’s health—we must first know what the problem is. Surprisingly, many caregivers of individuals with memory disorders or dementia report that the main problem is not the illness itself, but the ambiguity and uncertainty it causes.
It’s a difficult challenge to care for someone who is here, but not here—here physically, but gone mentally and psychologically. You feel alone, and in some ways, you are. For many caregivers, it’s as if there’s a stranger in the house.
Adding to the stress, disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease or traumatic brain injury cause unpredictable memory loss that comes and goes—one moment here, the next moment gone. This roller coaster of absence and presence is a very stressful kind of loss—what author Pauline Boss calls ambiguous loss. Unlike death, there is no closure, no official validation, and sometimes little community or religious support. You feel you are left to cope on your own; even the strongest caregivers feel anxious and depressed. The challenge is to learn strategies to cope with this ambiguity that is so much a part of memory loss.",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-and-ambiguous-loss/,Caregiving and Ambiguous Loss,"Caring for someone with a cognitive impairment—and the ambiguous feelings that arise—can create a constancy of sorrow that can immobilize caregivers. For example, decisions are put on hold, tasks pile up, chores delayed. Doubt, confusion, helplessness, and hopelessness set in, and caregivers can feel anxious and depressed. Friendships are in limbo as caregiving takes more and more of your time. Conflict increases with spouse, children/stepchildren, siblings. Family gatherings and rituals that were the glue of enjoyable family life are cancelled or changed. When a caregiver feels increasingly isolated, the possibility of depression, anxiety, abuse, guilt, shame, lack of self-care, illness, or substance abuse increases.",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-and-ambiguous-loss/,Caregiving and Ambiguous Loss,"To manage the stress of caregiving, try to connect with other people: if possible, join a support group either in person or on the Internet, attend a book club, social event, or faith-based group. Here are some ideas, questions and tips to help:
1. Name your problem.
Know that one real culprit causing your stress is the ambiguity from a loved one being here, but not here. Call it “ambiguous loss.” It is neither your fault nor the patient’s. It is caused by an illness.
2. Practice both/and thinking.
It helps to think “both/and” rather than in the extremes of “either/or.” Instead of thinking the care recipient has to be either here or gone, think of him or her as both here and gone. This means balancing two different ideas at the same time—present, and also absent. Both/and thinking is less stressful than continuing to search for an absolutely perfect solution.
Here are some examples:
“I am both a caregiver—and a person with my own needs.”
“I take care of both him—and myself.”
“I both wish it was over—and that my loved one could keep on living.” 
“I am both sad at my loved one’s illness—and joyful with my new grandchild.”
“I am both sad about my lost hopes and dreams—and happy about some new plans and goals.”
Now add your own examples. “Both/and” thinking may come faster if you practice with another person.
3. Know your “family” and community information and support systems.
You need predictability (not ambiguity) about whom you can talk to and count on for help. Have some other people become “like family” to you? Does your community offer help and social support? Spiritual support? Recreation and respite? Information support? Talk with your Caregiver Resource Center about what help is available to you. Check the web—a quick online search for “caregiver” offers a wealth of information and online communities. If your biological family offers no help, perhaps you can create a “psychological family” that will be there for you when you need help. Talk about how to divide up the work among a “care team.” Make a written plan to know who will do what and when. Who will come once a week so that you can take some time off to do as you wish? Who will come for a week twice a year so that you can take a vacation from caregiving? Several websites can help you establish your caregiving community (see Resources list below).
4. Continue—but revise—family holidays, celebrations, and rituals.
Do not cancel, but rather, simplify the gatherings with the people you care about to celebrate birthdays, holidays, and religious events and rituals. Families, friends, and communities connect to celebrate life’s transitions. Human connection can help lower your stress in times of sadness. It can help you and a person with dementia feel the spirit of life around you. This is essential to staying strong when the person you care for is not able to connect fully with you. Think and talk about this: what family rituals did you celebrate as a couple or family before the memory loss? Now? How can you simplify your family rituals and celebrations to fit the circumstances now? Young people can be especially helpful in answering these questions, because of their strong imaginations and new perspectives.
5. Revise family roles.
To manage the stress of caring for someone with severe memory loss, alterations are needed in what you and other family members previously did. There are changes in family roles as a result of the memory loss. What tasks are you now responsible for? What tasks have you lost? How do you manage these changes? What would help? Is there agreement in the family about who should do the caregiving? Are you resilient enough to change or do you feel you have to do  it all as before? Talk about who plays what roles in the family.
Finally, based on roles, think about how you see yourself now. You might ask: Is it right for me to take time off to go out with friends when my spouse is suffering from Alzheimer’s disease? Do I still feel like a son or daughter or more like a parent to my parent? If my spouse has memory loss, do I still feel married? How should I act?
6. Be aware of family rules.
Who is allowed to do what in your family? Is there a team approach or are you expected to do all the work alone? Become aware of your family’s rules and question them. They can change. Do your family’s rules about race, religion, class, age, or gender get talked about? For example, is there an unspoken rule in your family that only females can be caregivers? Are certain people excused from helping? Why are they excused? There may need to be a new family rule about “teamwork” so that caregiving does not fall to one person alone. Include children and teenagers in the circle of information about the illness, its effects, its unclear prognosis, and your need for help and teamwork.
7. Understand that anger and guilt are normal, but avoid harmful actions.
While mixed emotions are an understandable outcome of memory loss, the negative feelings can come out as anger or, worse yet, abuse—and that is not acceptable. Talk with someone—a professional or another caregiver—about your negative feelings to prevent acting out your anger. Remember, feeling angry about the ambiguity in memory loss is normal, but acting out that anger against the patient or yourself is not.
8. It seems contradictory, but imagine something new to hope for.
To stay healthy, everyone needs hope. When your loved one is ill, and you are tied to caregiving, you must discover new hope. It helps to talk about this with other people—and again, with young people. They might help you imagine new dreams for your future—new connections, new hobbies, new travel plans, new skills, new relationships.
Given the stress from caregiving and the ambiguity of memory loss, what can you plan for the future that is clear and certain? How about an outing, a firm date for dinner with a friend, a hobby that has clear outcomes, a TV program that you clearly enjoy? New hopes and dreams will emerge when you can balance the ambiguity with some activities that have clear outcomes, no matter how small.
9. Check on your own health.
Seek professional help if you:
Feel depressed, physically sick, or hopeless.
Feel like hurting yourself or hurting or yelling at the person you care for.
Depend too heavily on alcohol or recreational drugs.
Fight with your spouse, children, stepchildren, or other family members and friends.
No longer take care of yourself.
When you are a caregiver for someone with memory loss, the stress of ambiguity adds to the usual pressures of caregiving. You have a duty and a right to take care of yourself.",depression

The diagnosis of a dementing illness or disabling health condition marks a new stage in your life and your family’s life. Important decisions about care arise, along with uncertainty and anxiety. Some choices might need to be made right away. Others lie ahead.
If you’re caring for someone at home, you may be helping your loved one with a range of activities such as bathing, dressing, transportation, and food preparation. In addition, you may have to take care of legal and financial matters such as making medical decisions and handling bills and budgets. Fortunately, a variety of community care options are available to assist you and your loved one.
This fact sheet presents an overview of the different services and programs available to caregivers and individuals with cognitive disorders or other chronic health conditions. Organizations listed throughout the fact sheet can help you locate specific assistance. Additional information is provided in the Resources section at the end of the fact sheet.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-home-guide-community-resources/,Caregiving at Home: A Guide to Community Resources,"Defining your family’s particular needs is the first step in determining what kind of help and support will best suit your circumstances. With so many services available to caregivers, you will need to first outline your specific concerns. It’s also useful to think about the values and preferences of your loved one regarding the types of help he or she will accept. It might be helpful to hold a family meeting (see Holding a Family Meeting) to discuss care needs and help with decision making. Try asking yourself the following questions and writing the answers on a sheet of paper:
What type of help does my loved one need now to live as independently as possible? (Nutrition services, dressing, bathing, lifting, medication management, supervision, companionship, housekeeping, transportation?)
What types of help might be needed in the future?
Who in the family will take charge of caregiving and/or make arrangements for care?
How much money is available to pay for outside resources? Will insurance cover any services?
What days and times do I need help?
What kind of assistance can I provide myself?
Do I have a job that will affect the amount of care I can provide?
What types of help are my friends and family members willing to provide?
Can we get used to having a stranger in our home to help us?
Can we adjust to someone who speaks a different language?
Would a male or female helper be preferred?
Do we want out-of-home care? What kind? How often? How long?",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-home-guide-community-resources/,Caregiving at Home: A Guide to Community Resources,"Community care programs and services vary in different states, counties, and communities. Most areas now have support services specifically designed for people with Alzheimer’s, stroke, Parkinson’s, and other chronic health conditions. Each community, however, differs in the services available and their eligibility requirements. This section outlines the main community care options for the care recipient and their caregivers.
Informal care involves the help of friends, family, religious communities, neighbors, and others who can share the responsibilities of caregiving. This “informal” support network can help with specific tasks (e.g., household chores), provide emotional support to you and your loved one, and help the care recipient maintain a healthy level of social and recreational activity. Making a list of your informal “helper” network and their contact information will be an invaluable source of support for routine assistance or in times of emergency.
Information and referral (I&R) helps you identify your local resources. California’s Caregiver Resource Centers (www.caregiver.org/californias-caregiver-resource-centers), national Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs), senior centers, or community mental health programs are good resources that can help you find potential services, such as adult day care programs, respite care, and meals.
Staff members have information about the availability and appropriateness of services, whom to contact, eligibility requirements, and hours of operation. The organizations listed in our Resources section offer I&R as part of their services. FCA’s Family Care Navigator (www.caregiver.org/family-care-navigator) provides information on caregiving support services for all 50 states.
Care management services can locate and, if needed, provide hands-on management of services for your loved one. Professional care managers (also called case managers) usually have a background in counseling, social work, or a related healthcare field and are trained to assess your individual situation and to implement and monitor a care plan to meet the needs of your loved one. They work with you, the physician, and patient to identify and arrange services such as transportation, home care, meals, and day care. Additionally, care managers can help determine eligibility for entitlement programs, assist with family meetings, plan for long-term care, and intervene in crisis situations.
If you meet eligibility requirements, it may be possible to obtain free care management services through federal, state, or county programs such as Medicare or Medicaid (MediCal in California). Free or low-cost care consultation sometimes can be found through hospitals, mental health programs, home health agencies, social service agencies (e.g., Catholic Charities, Jewish Family Services, Adult Protective Services) and other health-related programs. In addition, it is possible to hire a private care manager, often called a geriatric care manager, who will typically charge between $75 and $150 per hour.
Legal and financial counseling is often needed when your loved one cannot manage legal and/or financial affairs. Areas of concern to family caregivers include Advance Directives for healthcare decisions, management of assets, public benefits planning and, in some cases, litigation. For individuals aged 60 or over and their caregivers, legal referrals and advice may be obtained from services provided by local Area Agencies on Aging. California residents may be eligible for a legal consultation through a California Caregiver Resource Center.
Another way to locate an attorney is through personal referrals or an attorney referral service. The Bar Association in your community may have a panel that refers callers to lawyers in elderlaw or other specializations. Initial consultations generally include a nominal fee.
Transportation services The Americans with Disabilities Act requires transit agencies to provide curb-to-curb paratransit service to individuals unable to use regular public transportation. Paratransit generally consists of wheelchair-accessible vans or taxis for people with disabilities. Paratransit may be run by private, nonprofit, and/or public organizations and is usually free or low-cost. To find out about paratransit in your community, contact your local Area Agency on Aging. Discounted taxi and ride-sharing services might also be available in your community.
Nutrition programs provide meals—usually lunch—in a group setting. Many churches, synagogues, housing projects, senior centers, community centers, schools, and day programs offer meals and opportunities to socialize as a service to elders in the community for a minimal fee.
For homebound individuals unable to shop for or prepare their own meals, home-delivered meals may be an option. Programs such as Meals on Wheels are offered in most communities, funded partially through government monies or by charitable organizations. The delivery includes a friendly visit and quick safety check for your loved one. Meals may only be delivered on weekdays, so you’ll need to be sure there is adequate food for the weekends. Most groups providing home-delivered meals charge a nominal fee (determined by each individual’s ability to pay) to help cover costs.
Respite care offers relief for family, partners, and friends so they can take a break—a respite—from the demands of providing constant care. Respite care can be crucial in deterring premature institutionalization of the patient and reducing physical and emotional stress for the caregiver. Respite care includes adult day care and home care services (see below), as well as overnight stays in a facility, and can be provided a few hours, a weekend, or even a week. Many caregiver support programs offer respite assistance as part of their services. Some organizations offer volunteer respite workers who provide companionship or protective supervision only. For information on respite care in your community, contact your Area Agency on Aging.
Adult day care offers participants the opportunity to socialize, enjoy peer support, and receive health and social services in a safe, familiar environment. It also provides a break for caregivers responsible for a person who can’t be left alone but who does not require 24-hour nursing care in a residential facility.
Adult day care services may include: care and supervision; small group and individual activities; nutritious meals; transportation; care management; recreation and exercise; nursing care; education; family counseling; dispensing medications; assistance with activities of daily living; and occupational, speech, and physical therapies.
There are two types of adult day care: Adult day care provides social activities, meals, recreation, and some health-related services. Adult day health care offers socializing along with more intensive health and therapeutic services for individuals with more severe medical problems, and those at risk of requiring nursing home care. Adult day care is particularly helpful for caregivers who cannot stay at home all day to provide the care, supervision, and companionship needed by a loved one. Although programs vary, participants ordinarily attend several hours a day, up to five days a week. The National Adult Day Services Association and your local Area Agency on Aging can help you find adult day care services. If eligibility requirements are met, Medicaid may help cover fees for adult day health services.
Home care combines health care and supportive services to help homebound sick or disabled persons continue living at home as independently as possible. The hours, types of services, and level of care provided are determined by the health and needs of the care recipient and the caregiver; physician approval may be needed. Aides can be hired directly or through a staffing agency.
There are two types of home care available to you: home health care services and non-medical home care services. Home health care services provide a wide range of medical services, including medication assistance, nursing services, and physical therapy. Nonmedical home care services include companionship, housekeeping, cooking, and many other household activities and chores.
The cost of home care depends on the level of care needed—a nonmedical home care attendant will charge less than a nurse who is monitoring the person’s medical needs and condition. Fees vary, so you might want to shop around. Medicare, Medicaid (MediCal in California), and some private insurance or long-term care policies pay for limited home health care with certain restrictions. In other cases, you may have to pay out of pocket. Nonmedical home care aides can be located through personal referrals or a private home care agency, hospital, social service agency, public health department, or other community organizations. In some areas nursing schools may be of assistance. For information on home care in your community, contact your local Area Agency on Aging.
Hospice care offers special services to improve the quality of life for terminally ill persons by controlling the symptoms of the illness and restoring dignity for the person until death. A team of professionals and volunteers work collaboratively with the patient and family to meet physical, psychological, social, and spiritual needs. They provide medical and nursing care, social services, dietary consultation, counseling, and emotional support to both the patient and the caregiver. Equipment such as hospital beds and wheelchairs is also provided.
Individuals receive ongoing scheduled visits as well as round-the-clock care when needed. Intrusive or “heroic” medical interventions are usually waived, depending on the patient’s wishes, and relief of severe pain is a common goal. Support to surviving loved ones usually continues during the bereavement period. Insurance coverage for hospice care is available through Medicare, Medicaid, and most private insurance plans. For information on hospice care, contact the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization.
Caregiver support groups bring together friends and family members who meet regularly to share information and discuss practical solutions to common problems. They are a good source of information on available resources. Support groups also provide caregivers with the opportunity to give and receive encouragement, understanding, and support from others who have similar concerns. Interacting with other caregivers can be a real help in reducing stress. Support groups can be found through hospitals, mental health programs, and support organizations (e.g., your local Caregiver Resource Center or Alzheimer’s Association chapter). Support groups for people with early Alzheimer’s disease or other disorders are also offered in some communities. Online support groups are available to caregivers with computer access. Family Caregiver Alliance offers three online groups.
Employee assistance programs are a benefit that your workplace may or may not offer. Types of assistance vary widely, and are available more frequently at larger companies. Programs generally provide employees with counseling for personal issues such as depression, stress, addiction, financial crisis, and illness or death in the family. Some programs may also assist with locating eldercare and childcare resources. Paid or unpaid leave from your job may also be available for caregivers through federal, state, and/or employer-provided programs. Ask your human resources department for information.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-home-guide-community-resources/,Caregiving at Home: A Guide to Community Resources,"Once you have assessed your needs and identified the types of resources available in your community, you can begin contacting community care services. Be aware that it can be a time-consuming experience to locate and arrange appropriate services. You may need to make a series of phone calls or go through a maze of referrals before you find the right program or person to help you. If you have a care manager or other health care provider who helped assess your needs, he or she should be able to help—it’s a care manager’s job to help you find resources, so don’t be afraid to ask for assistance.
The following suggestions will help guide you through the process:
Begin looking for resources before your situation becomes overwhelming. By planning ahead and anticipating certain needs, you can avoid having to make important decisions during a crisis.
Write down all information you are given. Be sure to document the date and name of each agency you called, phone number or website, who you spoke with, which services you requested, and any agreed-upon decisions.
When you make your call, be prepared with specific information, such as physician’s name, diagnostic information, insurance coverage and Medicare, Medicaid (MediCal in California) and Social Security numbers. Be prepared to answer questions such as “What type of care is the patient currently receiving and who is providing it?” and “Is there any special equipment in the home to assist with patient care?”
When dealing with agencies, be assertive and specific about your needs.
Mornings are usually the best time to call.
Don’t hang up until you understand the follow-up procedures and next steps.
Be aware that you might be placed on a waiting list. The demand for existing dementia-related services, in particular, has increased while the funding for some service programs has decreased. If you can anticipate your needs and the needs of your loved one, you’ll minimize the length of this waiting period.
If a fee is charged for the service, be sure to ask for a rate sheet that documents the service provided for each fee.
“Free” online referral services, especially for senior housing, may only promote those facilities that pay for a listing or placement fee. The listing or recommendation is not an indication of the quality of care provided.
Don’t hesitate to ask for help. The purpose of most community agencies is to provide services to individuals who need help. You are entitled to these services since many of them are paid for by your taxes, contributions, or fees for service.
Keep in mind that not everyone is familiar with the needs of caregivers. Therefore, many professionals remain uninformed about stresses on you and your loved one. You might find yourself in situations where you need to educate professionals in the community before you can obtain services successfully.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-during-national-emergency/,Caregiving During a National Emergency,"At times of emergency, such as the events of September 11 or Hurricane Katrina, there are so many things to process, one has trouble prioritizing and putting things in perspective. If you are caring for a loved one with dementia, you probably found your attention distracted and your emotions conflicted. Sometimes it was hard to concentrate on the daily things in life, sometimes it was reassuring to do mundane tasks. Often people feel out of control and insecure at times of crisis. Perhaps the suggestions below will help when times are unsettled —for any reason.
People with dementia might not understand what is going on around them. However, they do pick up emotions, might have a partial understanding which has led to greater confusion, and their needs might be overlooked. Although this is understandable, it can increase the problems of the caregiver. Your loved one might be more anxious, less willing to do things, more difficult to distract and have sleep disturbances. Depending on the severity of the dementia, he/she might make irrelevant comments or laugh inappropriately. Since long term memory is generally more intact, he/she might fixate on an earlier time with some similar aspects to the current situation.
 There are a number of ways you might be successful in reducing agitation. First of all, do not watch TV incessantly. If at all possible and depending on the level of the dementia, it would be good to avoid having the person with dementia see the TV coverage of the event all together, including radio and newspaper coverage. Everyone should, in fact, limit the number of hours spent watching a disaster. It has been shown that endless watching can in and of itself lead to post traumatic stress disorder. You can talk about the incident with the person in general terms. One caregiver was asked by her husband, “How are things going with the accident?” Although she wanted to scream, “It wasn’t an accident,” she could say to him that the government was doing everything possible to help the situation. This form of reassurance is important.
Second, it is helpful to maintain routines as much as possible. Routines are reassuring to people with dementia, and they will be calmer if their daily schedule is kept. You might find that keeping a routine is reassuring for yourself as well, allowing you to focus on tasks without too much thinking.
 Finally, it is important to take care of yourself. Do not watch too much TV. Gather whatever friends and family you have around you, allow yourself to feel nurtured and connected with others as much as possible. We all feel fragile and insecure in the face of a disaster and we need to find reassurance and connectedness. It can feel particularly lonely when our loved one cannot respond in kind to our needs at times like this. Reach out to someone, attend religious services or log on to a chat room. And please lower your expectations of yourself, slow down, do what feels nurturing for yourself and be very patient with yourself and your loved one. When feeling stressed, our nerves often feel raw and we might find ourselves being snappy or cranky. Forgive yourself for not being perfect; it is understandable under the circumstances.
 At the preventive level, it is always good to have a disaster plan at your house. Is there back up for someone to care for your loved one in case you can’t make it home? Can someone pick him/her up from daycare? Do you have an extra week of medication stored away in case you couldn’t get to the pharmacy in an emergency? Do you keep water supplies and canned foods somewhere accessible? These are things that all people, especially those who live in California earthquake country, need to think about anyway. But given the events of last September, we need always to be prepared for that which we can’t control and can’t predict.  For an emergency preparedness checklist click here.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-with-your-siblings/,Caregiving with Your Siblings,"Providing care for your parents can be complicated. When your brothers and sisters are also involved, caregiving can become even more complex. While your siblings can be enormously helpful and your best support, they can also be a source of stress.
In this fact sheet, you will learn how to identify the family dynamics that can impact caregiving, ways your siblings can help, how to increase your chances of getting that help, and how to deal with emotions that arise.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-with-your-siblings/,Caregiving with Your Siblings,"Todayʼs adult children and their parents are going through a new kind of family transition. Because parents are living longer—but with chronic illnesses—their adult children are now caring for them for up to a decade or more. Siblings—or in some cases step-siblings—might not have a model for how to work together to handle caregiving and the many practical, emotional, and financial issues that go with it. There is no clear path guiding who should do what, no roadmap for how siblings should interact as mature adults. While some families are able to work out differences, many others struggle.
Siblings are also going through a major emotional passage that stirs up feelings from childhood. Watching our parents age and die is one of the hardest things in life, and everyone in the family will handle it differently.
Itʼs normal to feel a wide range of emotions. You may find that needs arise for love, approval, or being seen as important or competent as a sibling. You may not even be conscious of these feelings, but they affect the way you deal with your parents and with each other. So without realizing it, you may all be competing with each other as you did when you were kids. Now, however, the fights are over caregiving: who does or doesnʼt do it; how much; and who is in charge.
This is a hard time, so have compassion for yourself, and try to have compassion for your siblings. You donʼt have to excuse negative behavior, but try to imagine the fear, pain, or need that is causing your siblings to react as they do. That kind of understanding can defuse a lot of family conflict.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-with-your-siblings/,Caregiving with Your Siblings,"Families often donʼt think through who becomes the primary caregiver and what supporting roles other family members will play. Caregiving may start when the sibling who lives nearby or has a close relationship to the parent helps out with small things. You may not even identify yourself as a caregiver at first, but then find yourself overwhelmed and feeling resentful of your siblings as your parent requires more help. Itʼs easy for families to fall into common traps, assuming, for example, that the son will handle finances while the daughter will take care of emotional or physical care needs.
In another common trap, one sibling may become Momʼs caregiver because he or she doesnʼt have a job or needs a place to stay, and family members think this arrangement will solve a lot of problems. But it can be a recipe for trouble. The family needs to spell out clearly what that person will be expected to do, whether there will be financial compensation, and how that will work. In addition, the sibling(s) should be clear about what support tasks each will provide.
You need to re-examine all these assumptions as a family. The best way to do this is to call a family meeting as early (and, later, as often) as possible. A family meeting can provide a place to discuss the parentʼs needs and to ask what each person can contribute in time or money. If needed, a trusted person outside the family can facilitate. ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-with-your-siblings/,Caregiving with Your Siblings,"Whenever we get together with family, most of us tend to slip into our old roles, even though we behave differently when we are with other people. But these roles may not work anymore. Parents may not be able to play the parts they did when the family was young, like making the decisions, providing emotional support, or smoothing tensions between family members.
Maybe you were expected to be the responsible one; maybe your brother was seen as someone who needed taking care of. Maybe your other sister was groomed to go off and become the achiever while family chores were left to others. Perhaps you were identified as the “caring” one while your sister was labeled “selfish” or “cold.” So ask yourself: am I being pulled into being the big sister or the helpless little kid even though weʼre all adults now?
Also, itʼs helpful now to take a fresh look at your siblings. Parents create labels and roles for each child, and everyone in the family adopts them and assumes they are true. They may be based on some reality, but parents may also assign these labels for all kinds of reasons: who was born first or last, which kid reminds Mom of her older sister (whom she resented), which kid is most like Dad in personality—and how Mom feels about Dad!
Whatever the reasons for these roles, we need to re-examine them now. If you were the “responsible” one, it does not mean that you should accept doing everything because you always did—even though your siblings may expect you to take on that role. You may need to help them see that you can all adapt your roles to new times and who you are today. Also, if you assume a brother or sister is less capable or helpful because thatʼs the way you saw them as kids, you are less likely to get help from them. If you approach them differently, they may prove to be more helpful than you think possible.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-with-your-siblings/,Caregiving with Your Siblings,"The idea that you may soon lose Mom or Dad, or that they need more care, can be really scary. Some adult children still need their Mom to be the parent. Some get over-anxious and think the parent is in bigger trouble than they are. Some just canʼt accept that the parents need as much help as they do. These differences are common. Here are some ways to handle this:
If thereʼs no emergency, allow some time to get everyone on the same page. Itʼs natural for siblings to take in the situation at different times and in different ways. This can happen regardless of whether theyʼre far away or close.
Share information. Get a professional assessment of your parentʼs condition by a doctor, social worker, or geriatric care manager and send the report to all your siblings. Try using email, online care sharing tools, and/or in-person family meetings to help keep everyone abreast of care issues and information.
Keep in mind that parents often tell their kids different things about how theyʼre doing. This is a good reason to keep communication lines open with each other and to try to pool your information about your parentʼs health.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-with-your-siblings/,Caregiving with Your Siblings,"Itʼs natural to take pride in being able to help your parent, or feel satisfaction that you are doing something important and valuable. When these basic needs are satisfied, caregivers feel good about what theyʼre doing and feel less burdened.
But you may also have other less conscious, emotional needs that can actually make things harder for you. For example, if you feel you must make your Mom happy—when sheʼs never been a happy person or has suffered painful losses—you may be setting yourself up for an impossible task. You can make sure your parents are well cared for, but it isnʼt your job—nor is it always possible—to make them happy.
So try to focus on the essential things your parent needs for good care. For example, if you insist on doing all Momʼs shopping because only you know what she likes, you may exhaust yourself. And itʼs hardly a tragedy if your sister buys her a different brand of tuna.
When those old needs to be loved and approved of get stirred up, it can fire up sibling rivalry. After all, youʼre not the only child who needs to feel important to Mom or Dad. So when youʼre discussing whether Dad needs a more expensive wheelchair or Mom is still safe at home, try to keep the discussion on the concrete issue at hand, not on which of you cares the most or knows what is best.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-with-your-siblings/,Caregiving with Your Siblings,"Your level of emotion is out of proportion to the specific thing being discussed right now. For example: getting into a heated argument about which of you should go to the doctor with Dad next week.
You or your siblings criticize the way you think another person is being, for example: selfish, bossy, uncaring, irresponsible, or worse.
You feel that none of your siblings understands what Mom needs the way you do and you are the only one who can do certain things.
You or your siblings generalize a discussion, saying, for example, “You always do this!”
You or your siblings criticize the way one another feels, for example, “You donʼt care anything about Mom.”
When you become furious or terribly hurt in a dispute with your sibling, try to step back, calm down, and focus just on the issue at hand, e.g. getting Dad to his doctor appointment.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caregiving-with-your-siblings/,Caregiving with Your Siblings,"Try to accept your siblings—and your parents—as they really are, not who you wish they were. Families are complicated and never perfect. There are no “shoulds” about how people feel. They are not bad people or bad children if they donʼt feel the same as you do. If you can accept this, you are likelier to get more support from them, or, at least, less conflict.
 Do not over-simplify. Itʼs easy to assume that you are completely right and your siblings are all wrong—or lazy, irresponsible, uncaring, etc. Each person has a different relationship with your parent, and each personʼs outlook is bound to be different.
 Ask yourself what you really want from your siblings. Before you can ask for what you want, you need to figure this out, and thatʼs not always as simple as it seems. First of all, ask yourself whether you really, deep down, want help. Many caregivers say they do but actually discourage help. So think hard. Do you want them to do certain tasks regularly? Do you want them to give you time off once in a while? Or do you feel you have everything under control but youʼd like them to contribute money for services or respite?
 Or—and this is a big one for many caregivers—do you really not want them to do anything but youʼd like more emotional support? Many caregivers feel lonely, isolated, and unappreciated. If youʼd like your siblings to check in on you more, ask them to call once a week. And tell them it would really help if they would say “thanks” or tell you youʼre doing a good job. They are more likely to do this if you donʼt criticize them for what they are not doing.
Ask for help clearly and effectively.
Asking is the first step. You might ask for help by saying: “Can you stay with Mom every Thursday? I have to get the shopping done for the week and it gives me some time to myself.” Donʼt fall into the common trap of thinking, “I shouldnʼt have to ask.” Your siblings may assume that you have everything covered so they donʼt recognize the added responsibilities and “burden.” They are involved with their own lives and struggles and not so attuned to yours that they can read your mind. Also, if youʼre not exactly sure what you want from them, you may be giving them mixed messages.
Ask directly and be specific. Many caregivers hint or complain or send magazine articles about the hardships of eldercare. But these strategies do not work well.
Ask for whatʼs realistic. People get more when they donʼt ask for the impossible. So consider the relationship your sibling has with Mom or Dad and ask for what that person can really give. If your sister canʼt spend ten minutes with Mom without screaming at her, donʼt ask her to spend time; ask for something thatʼs easier for her, like doing paperwork or bringing groceries.
  Watch how you ask for help—and steer clear of the cycle of guilt and anger.
Avoid making your siblings feel guilty. Yes, really. Guilt makes people uncomfortable and defensive. They might get angry, minimize or criticize what you are doing, or avoid you. That is likely to make you angry, and then you will try harder to make them feel guilty. They will attack back or withdraw even more. And round and round you go.
Sometimes your siblings will criticize you because they are genuinely concerned about your parents. Try to listen to these concerns without judgment and consider whether it is useful feedback. At the same time, be bold by asking for appreciation for all that you are doing—and remember to say thanks back when someone is helpful.
Be careful of your tone and language when you request something. Itʼs not always easy to hear the way we sound to others. You might think you are asking for help in a nice way, but if youʼre angry, thatʼs the tone your siblings will hear. And theyʼre likely to react in unhelpful ways.
  Get help from a professional outside the family. Families have long, complicated histories, and during this very emotional passage, it is often hard to communicate with each other without overreacting, misinterpreting, or fighting old battles. Even the healthiest families can sometimes use the help of an objective professional. People like family therapists, social workers, geriatric care managers, physicians, or clergy can help siblings establish what is real about a parentʼs health and needs in order to help distribute responsibilities more equitably. In family meetings, they can help you stay focused on the topic at hand and help you avoid bringing up old arguments.
 Steer clear of power struggles over your parent’s assignment of legal powers. Whether or not you have been given your parentʼs legal powers over finances or health, you need to remember that it is your parent who has made these decisions. If you have your Momʼs or Dadʼs power of attorney, be sure to keep detailed records and send your siblings statements about how you have spent Momʼs money. This may seem like a lot of extra work, but record keeping is required by law, and being open will reduce distrust or distortion—and lawsuits. If a sibling has been given legal power, try to accept your parentʼs decision and donʼt take it as a personal attack on you. Do your best to work with the sibling who has the authority by presenting expenses and bills in black and white. If the sibling who has the purse strings doesnʼt cooperate, then bring in a professional to explain your parentʼs needs and to mediate. If you are concerned about manipulation, a changed will, or undue influence, contact your local Adult Protective Services.
 Donʼt let inheritance disputes tear your family apart. If you feel wronged by the way your parents have divided their money and property, itʼs natural to be upset, especially when you are grieving. You may feel that you deserve more because you have cared for your parents. If thatʼs what you feel, you need to discuss this with your parents while they are alive and can make these decisions. If you suspect foul play by another sibling, then this is the time to consult an attorney or Adult Protective Services.
Yet, research shows that most parents feel a need to leave their estates equally as a sign of their equal love for all their children. When they divide things unequally, itʼs often because they are worried that a particular child will be in greater need. Whatever their reasons, remember that it was your parents, not your siblings, who decided this. Think hard before you take your anger or disappointment out on your siblings. They are what remains of your original family, and for most people, this relationship becomes more important after parents die.",[]

“Mostly, it’s been rough,” says Sloss, 60, of South Pasadena, Calif. “But we have been blessed with a lot of support.”
The brothers first sought help from their family’s church, which offered a respite when their parents attended Bible study and fellowship for a few years after their diagnoses. But that ended when the elder couple’s physical ailments made it too difficult to transport them to and from services.
Eventually, the brothers found the USC Family Caregiver Support Center, which has connected them with support groups, caregiver classes and services that give them breaks from caregiving.
The USC organization is one of 11 nonprofit Caregiver Resource Centers across California that serve about 14,000 families a year. Their aim is to offer low-cost or free services, regardless of income, to people caring for someone 18 or older.
Their offerings include stress-busting activities like yoga and meditation; legal and financial consultations; and tips on how to choose a home health agency, talk to doctors or manage difficult behavior.
“This was designed to help everyone, including middle-income families,” says Donna Benton, director of the USC center.
A 2015 report by the AARP Public Policy Institute and the National Alliance for Caregiving found that roughly 43.5 million adults in the United States had provided unpaid care to an adult or child in the prior year.
The need is expected to increase as baby boomers age and become caregivers for loved ones or require care for themselves, says Amy Goyer, AARP’s family and caregiving expert.
“As our health care improves, people live longer, but they tend to live longer with chronic illnesses or conditions,” she says.
There also will be a declining number of caregivers for those in need, because Americans are having fewer children and family structures are changing, Goyer adds.
Simply put, caregiving is hard, it may get harder, and it often leads to emotional, physical and financial hardship.
“People tend to think it’s something temporary … like a sprint, and then it turns into a marathon,” Benton says. “And then you have all the wrong coping tools. Then you burn out.”
Goyer cares for her father, who is 93 and has Alzheimer’s disease. Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s or dementia adds an extra burden because of its intensity, she says. “It’s caregiving on steroids because of the constancy of it.”
Help is available, much of it for free. But the network of resources is like a “puzzle you put together,” Goyer says, so be prepared to make multiple calls and queries to different organizations.
If you’re in California, start with the Caregiver Resource Centers. Find out which one serves your county through the Family Caregiver Alliance or calling the USC center at 800-540-4442 to be transferred to the right location.
A staff member will work directly with you to determine what you need.
“We’re there as a comprehensive, one-stop center,” Benton says. “If you have someone who helps you cut through the red tape, it can save you hours and days of aggravation.”
Whether or not you’re in California, Goyer suggests, reach out to your local Area Agency on Aging, which can also connect you with resources. Visit eldercare.acl.gov and enter your ZIP code to find local contact information.
When you call, request a personalized assessment of your situation, Goyer recommends.
“Always ask them, ‘What support do you have for caregivers?’ The person you’re caring for might be eligible for chore services or housekeeping or respite care,” which can give you a break from caregiving, she says. “In some cases, if their income qualifies them for Medicaid, they might be able to get home health aides.”
The Family Caregiver Alliance, a national group based in San Francisco, can link you to support, most of it free. Visit www.caregiver.org and click on the “CareNav™” tab to fill out the online survey.
After you receive personalized suggestions, you can follow up with a staff member online or by phone (800-445-8106), says Executive Director Kathleen Kelly.
The alliance, which has been helping caregivers for nearly 40 years, says its clients frequently ask how they can better care for their loved ones, where they can find emotional support for themselves and whether they can get paid for the care they are already providing, since many of them had to quit their jobs, Kelly says.
Their needs change over time. “We’re a place that people can come back to,” she says. “We deal with people over the long term.”
If you’re interested in doing more digging:
Visit aarp.org/caregiving, where you can find help in multiple languages, free online webinars and resource guides.
Contact disease-specific organizations such as the Alzheimer’s Association or the American Cancer Society; or Leeza’s Care Connection, which offers resources and information for caregivers.
Reach out to friends, family members, neighbors and your place of worship, if you have one. Hospitals often have social workers who can help connect you to services.
Sloss, the South Pasadena resident, has taken classes that have taught him to better communicate with his parents and defuse confrontational behavior. He and his brother have also benefited from respite care, which allows them to have some time for themselves. And they have relied on their caregiver group for emotional support.
“Those are people going through the same things you’re going through and can really identify with your situations,” Sloss says. He urges other caregivers not to forget about their own health and happiness.
“Seek help. You should definitely get a respite, whether it’s from a family member, friend or organization, because you need time to recharge,” Sloss says.
“Unfortunately, some of the patients outlive the caregivers because the caregivers don’t necessarily take care of themselves.”",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caring-adults-cognitive-and-memory-impairment/,Caring for Adults with Cognitive and Memory Impairment,"Most people will become caregivers—or need one—at some point in their lives. A caregiver is anyone who provides basic assistance and care for someone who is frail, disabled, or ill and needs help. Caregivers perform a wide variety of tasks to assist someone else in his or her daily life, for example, balancing a checkbook, grocery shopping, assisting with doctor’s appointments, giving medications, or helping someone to eat, take a bath, or dress. Many family members and friends do not consider such assistance and care “caregiving”—they are just doing what comes naturally to them: taking care of someone they love. But that care may be required for months or years, and may take an emotional, physical, and financial toll on caregiving families.
For some people, caregiving occurs gradually over time. For others, it can happen overnight. Caregivers may be full- or part-time; live with their loved one, or provide care from a distance. For the most part, friends, neighbors, and most of all, families, provide—without pay—the vast majority of care.
Many American families care for an adult with a cognitive (brain) impairment. Cognitively-impaired people have difficulty with one or more of the basic functions of their brain, such as perception, memory, concentration, and reasoning skills. Common causes of cognitive impairment include Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, brain injury, brain tumor, or HIV-associated dementia. Although each disorder has its own unique features, family members and caregivers often share common problems, situations, and strategies.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caring-adults-cognitive-and-memory-impairment/,Caring for Adults with Cognitive and Memory Impairment,"We know that cognitive and memory impairments can change how a person thinks, acts, and/or feels. These changes often present special challenges for families and caregivers. An ordinary conversation, for example, can be quite frustrating when your loved one has difficulty remembering from one moment to the next what has been said.
Individuals with moderate to severe dementia or another cognitive impairment often require special care, including supervision (sometimes 24 hours a day), specialized communication techniques, and management of difficult behavior. They may need help with activities of daily living (called “ADLs”), such as bathing, eating, transferring from bed to a chair or wheelchair, toileting, and/or other personal care.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caring-adults-cognitive-and-memory-impairment/,Caring for Adults with Cognitive and Memory Impairment,"Individuals with cognitive impairment may experience a range of behavioral problems that can be frustrating for caregivers. These might include communication difficulties, perseveration (fixation on/repetition of an idea or activity), aggressive or impulsive behaviors, paranoia, lack of motivation, memory problems, incontinence, poor judgment, and wandering. Some people may develop behavioral problems early on, while others go their entire illness with only minor issues. Most cognitively-impaired persons fall somewhere in the middle, having good days and bad days (or even good or bad moments). Anticipating that there will be ups and downs, and maintaining patience, compassion, and a sense of humor will help you cope more effectively with difficult behavior. It’s important to remember that it’s the disease, not the person, causing the behavior.
Helpful suggestions for managing these problems include communication techniques, such as keeping language simple and asking one question at a time. Break down tasks and questions. For example, instead of asking, “would you like to come in and sit down and have a snack?,” use simple statements such as, “sit down here,” and “here’s a snack for you.” Allow some time to respond for each question and request.
Wandering and poor judgment may signal the need for 24-hour supervision. Be sure to review the home safety checklist and know whom to contact in your community in case of an emergency. If wandering or aggressive behaviors are problems, you may need to contact emergency, police, fire, or medical systems. (For additional information, see FCA fact sheets Caregiver’s Guide to Understanding Dementia Behaviors, and Dementia, Caregiving, and Controlling Frustration.)",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caring-adults-cognitive-and-memory-impairment/,Caring for Adults with Cognitive and Memory Impairment,"Whether you have moved into the role of caregiver gradually or suddenly, you may feel alone, unprepared, and overwhelmed by what is expected of you. These feelings, as well as other emotions—fear, sadness, anxiety, guilt, frustration, and even anger—are normal, and may come and go throughout your time of providing care. Although it may not seem possible, along with challenges will come the unanticipated gifts of caregiving—forgiveness, compassion, courage—that can weave hardship into hope and healing.
Each caregiving family faces unique circumstances, but some general strategies can help you navigate the path ahead. As a traveler in new terrain, it is wise to educate yourself as best you can about the landscape and develop a plan accordingly, with the flexibility to accommodate changes along the way. Below are ten steps to help you set your course.
Step 1. Lay the foundation. Establishing a baseline of information lays the groundwork for making current and future care decisions. Talk with your loved one, family, and friends: What was Mom “normally” like? How has she changed? How long has she been forgetting to take her medicine? When did she stop paying her bills? Answers to questions such as these help create a picture of what is going on and for how long. This basic information not only gives you a realistic view of the situation, but also provides an important foundation for professionals who may be called in to make a more formal assessment.
Step 2. Get a medical assessment and diagnosis. It’s very important for your loved one to get a comprehensive medical exam from a qualified health care team that reviews both physical and mental health. Many medical conditions can cause dementia-like symptoms, such as depression and medication interactions. Often these conditions can be reversed if they are caught early enough. Additionally, new drug treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases may be most effective in the early stages of the disease. A confirmed diagnosis is essential in accurately determining treatment options, identifying risks, and planning for the future. Take your loved one to a memory disorder clinic, if one exists in your community, to get an accurate diagnosis.
Step 3. Educate yourself, your loved one, and your family. Information is empowering. Talk to doctors, health and social service professionals, and people going through similar experiences. Read books and brochures. Do research at the library and on the Internet. Learn how the disease progresses, the level of care that will be needed, and what resources may be available to help. Keep a notebook and a file folder of information you collect that you can refer back to when needed. Knowledge will increase your confidence and may reduce the anxiety and fear that many of us feel in the face of the unknown. (See the FCA fact sheet on Caregiving at Home: A Guide to Community Resources for more information about finding help in your community.)
Step 4. Determine your loved one’s needs. Care assessment tools include a variety of questionnaires and tests designed to determine the level of assistance someone needs and establishes their personal preferences for care (e.g., bathing in the morning rather than the afternoon). Each situation is different. While one person in the beginning stages of Alzheimer’s may need assistance with grocery shopping and bill paying, another in later stages may have problems with dressing, eating, and hygiene.
Assessments usually consider at least the following categories:
Personal care: bathing, eating, dressing, toileting, grooming
Household care: cooking, cleaning, laundry, shopping, finances
Health care: medication management, physician’s appointments, physical therapy
Emotional care: companionship, meaningful activities, conversation
Supervision: oversight for safety at home and to prevent wandering
Some hospitals, Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs), city or county agencies, Caregiver Resource Centers, or other government or private organizations offer consultation and assessments specifically designed for older people (called geriatric or needs assessments) for little, if any, cost. Another option is hiring, for a fee, a geriatric care manager or licensed clinical social worker. (See Resources for help in locating someone near you.) These professionals can be helpful in guiding you to the best care in your area, advise you on community resources, assist in arranging for services, and provide you and your loved one with continuity and familiarity throughout the illness.
Step 5. Outline a care plan. Once your loved one has received a diagnosis and completed a needs assessment, it will be easier for you, possibly with help from a professional, to formulate a care plan—a strategy to provide the best care for your loved one and yourself. It’s a good idea to take some time to think about both short- and long-term needs.
This plan will always be a “work in progress,” as your loved one’s needs will change over time. To start developing a plan, first list the things you are capable of, have time for, and are willing to do. Then list those things that you would like or need help with, now or in the future. Next, list all your “informal supports”—that is, siblings, other family, friends, neighbors—and think about how each person might be able to provide assistance. List any advantages and disadvantages that might be involved in asking these people to help. Write down ideas for overcoming the disadvantages. Repeat the list for “formal” support (e.g., community services, paid home care workers, day programs).
It is important to set a time frame for any action or activities planned. Also, it is wise to have a back-up plan should something happen to you, both for the short-term and the long-term.
 
Step 6. Look at finances. Most people prefer to keep their financial affairs private. In order to best prepare and provide for a loved one’s care; however, you will need to gain a full understanding of his or her financial assets and liabilities. This transition can be uncomfortable and difficult. Consider having an attorney or financial planner assist you through the process (see the FCA fact sheet Legal Planning for Incapacity). Assistance from a trained professional may reduce family tension and, if desired, provide you with a professional financial assessment and advice. Try to include your loved one as much as possible in this process.
Next, develop a list of financial assets and liabilities: checking and savings accounts, Social Security income, certificates of deposit, stocks and bonds, real estate deeds, insurance policies and annuities, retirement or pension benefits, credit card debts, home mortgages and loans, and so forth. It’s best to keep all these records in one or two places, such as a safety deposit box and a home file cabinet, and regularly update them. Keep a record of when to expect money coming in and when bills are due. You may need to establish a system to pay bills—perhaps you’ll need to open a new checking account or add your name to an existing one.
Step 7. Review legal documents. Like finances, legal matters can also be a delicate, but necessary, subject to discuss. Clear and legally binding documents ensure that your loved one’s wishes and decisions will be carried out. These documents can authorize you or another person to make legal, financial, and health care decisions on behalf of someone else. Again, having an attorney bring up the issue and oversee any necessary paperwork can take the pressure off of you, as well as provide assurance that you are legally prepared for what lies ahead. (For more information about types of legal documents, see FCA fact sheet Legal Planning for Incapacity.)
Other legal documents that you will want to find and place in an accessible location include Social Security numbers, birth, marriage and death certificates, divorce decrees and property settlements, military records, income tax returns, and wills (including the attorney’s name and executor), trust agreements, and burial arrangements. (See FCA worksheet/form Where to Find My Important Papers.)
At some point, you may need to determine eligibility for such public programs as Medicaid. It’s helpful to speak with an elderlaw specialist. Information about low-cost elder legal services may be available through the Area Agency on Aging in your community.
Step 8. Safety-proof your home. Caregivers often learn, through trial and error, the best ways to help an impaired relative maintain routines for eating, hygiene, and other activities at home. You may need special training in the use of assistive equipment and managing difficult behavior. It is also important to follow a safety checklist:
Be aware of potential dangers from:
Fire hazards such as stoves, other appliances, cigarettes, lighters, and matches
Sharp objects such as knives, razors, and sewing needles
Poisons, medicines, hazardous household products
Loose rugs, furniture, and cluttered pathways
Inadequate lighting
Water heater temperature—adjust setting to avoid burns from hot water
Cars—do not allow an impaired person to drive
Items outside that may cause falls, such as hoses, tools, gates, uneven pavement
Loose clothing and foot wear that may cause falls
Be sure to provide:
Emergency exits, locks to secure the house, and, if necessary, door alarms or an identification bracelet and a current photo in case your loved one wanders
Bathroom grab bars and grips, non-skid rugs, mats, paper cups rather than glass
Supervision of food consumption to ensure proper nutrition, and to monitor intake of too much or too little food
Emergency phone numbers and information
Medication monitoring
Supervision of alcohol and drug use for fall prevention and proper nutrition
Step 9. Connect with others. Joining a support group will connect you with other caregivers facing similar circumstances. Support group members provide one another with social and emotional support, as well as practical information and advice about local resources. Support groups also provide a safe and confidential place for caregivers to vent frustrations, share ideas, and learn new caregiving strategies. If you can’t get away from the house, online support groups offer opportunities to connect with other caregivers nationwide. (See Resources below to find a support group.) Another way to meet others going through a similar experience is by attending special workshops or meetings sponsored by organizations such as the local chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association or Multiple Sclerosis Society.
Step 10. Take care of yourself. Although this step appears last on this list, it is the most important step. Caregiving is stressful, particularly for those caring for someone with dementia. Caregivers are more likely than their noncaregiving peers to be at risk for depression, heart disease, high blood pressure and other chronic illnesses, even death. Caregivers of persons with dementia are at even higher risk for poor health. The following simple, basic preventative healthcare and self-care measures can improve your health and your ability to continue providing the best care for your loved one.
Practice daily exercise. Incorporating even a small amount of regular exercise into your daily routine can do wonders—it can improve your night’s sleep, reduce stress and negative emotions, relax muscular tension, and increase your mental alertness and energy levels. Recent research shows health benefits from walking just 20 minutes a day, three times a week. Talk to your doctor about an exercise routine that is best for you.
Eat nutritious meals and snacks. Caregivers often fall into poor eating habits—eating too much or too little, snacking on junk food, skipping meals and so on. Much of eating is habit, so make it a point each week to add a new healthy eating habit. For example, if breakfast is simply a cup of coffee, try adding just one healthy food—a piece of fresh fruit, a glass of juice, whole-grain toast. Small changes add up, and can be realistically incorporated into a daily schedule.
Get adequate sleep. Many caregivers suffer from chronic lack of sleep, resulting in exhaustion, fatigue, and low energy levels. Depleted physical energy in turn affects our emotional outlook, increasing negative feelings such as irritability, sadness, anger, pessimism, and stress. Ideally, most people need six to eight hours of sleep in a 24-hour period. If you are not getting enough sleep at night, try to take catnaps during the day. If possible, make arrangements to get at least one full night’s rest each week or several hours of sleep during the day. If the person you care for is awake at night, make arrangements for substitute care or talk to his or her physician about sleep medication.
Get regular medical check-ups. Even if you have always enjoyed good health, being a caregiver increases your risk for developing a number of health problems. Regular medical (and dental) check-ups are important health maintenance steps. Inform your doctor of your caregiving role and how you are coping. Depression is a common and treatable disease. If you are experiencing symptoms such as a lingering sadness, apathy, and hopelessness tell your doctor. (See the FCA fact sheet Depression and Caregiving.)
Take time for yourself. Recreation is not a luxury, it is a necessary time to “re-create”—to renew yourself. At least once a week for a few hours at a time, you need time just for yourself—to read a book, go out to lunch with a friend, or go for a walk. (See the FCA fact sheet Taking Care of YOU: Self-Care for Family Caregivers for more helpful tips.)",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caring-adults-cognitive-and-memory-impairment/,Caring for Adults with Cognitive and Memory Impairment,"If you care for a person with dementia, you face even greater risks for health problems than other caregivers. You are particularly at risk for caregiver burnout—a state of mental and physical exhaustion brought on by the physical, mental, emotional and/or financial stresses of providing ongoing care, usually over a long period of time. Symptoms include difficulty concentrating, anxiety, irritability, digestive problems, depression, problems sleeping, and social withdrawal. Caregiver burnout puts both you and your loved one at risk. It is one of the most-cited reasons for caregivers placing a loved one in a nursing home or other long-term care facility.
One of the most effective ways to prevent caregiver burnout is by taking care of your physical health needs, as well as your mental and social health needs. Essential to meeting these needs is to schedule regular time off from your caregiving duties. If you do not have a neighbor, family member, or friend nearby who can provide dependable weekly help, look into respite services in your community (See Resources below.)
Respite literally means a rest—a break away from the demands of caregiving. Respite can be arranged for varying lengths of time—a few hours, overnight, a weekend, even for a week or longer. It can be provided in your home or in a facility such as adult day care or a nursing home. In-home attendants may be employed by an agency, self-employed, or volunteers. Respite care can be arranged privately for a fee, paid for by some long-term care insurance policies, or sometimes provided by government or private organizations.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caring-adults-cognitive-and-memory-impairment/,Caring for Adults with Cognitive and Memory Impairment,"The number of services for cognitively-impaired adults, their families and caregivers is growing, although in some communities, agencies may be difficult to locate. A good place to start is the Eldercare Locator, a free nationwide toll-free service that is designed to assist older adults and their caregivers to find services in their community. Family Caregiver Alliance offers assistance as well. (See Resources for contact information.)
Consider contacting senior centers, independent living centers, Area Agencies on Aging, local chapters of national organizations and foundations such as the Alzheimer’s Association, Brain Injury Association, Multiple Sclerosis Society, Parkinson’s groups, and others. Nursing home ombudsman programs, community mental health centers, social service or case management agencies, schools of nursing, and church groups may be other sources of assistance. In California, regional Caregiver Resource Centers offer information and services. Most supportive organizations are listed in the phone book under “Social Services” or “Seniors,” and many are on the Internet. Each time you talk to someone, ask for referrals and phone numbers of others who may assist you.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caring-adults-cognitive-and-memory-impairment/,Caring for Adults with Cognitive and Memory Impairment,"The Internet provides a wealth of information for caregivers, from an organization’s mission and contact information, to online support groups, to articles about overcoming the challenges of caregiving. Most public libraries, universities, and many senior centers have computers and Internet access available for free public use. If you do not know how to use a computer or how to access the Internet, don’t be shy—organization personnel are trained to how you how to get the information you are looking for. Once you get to a search engine such as Yahoo or Google, type in the search terms—the general information you are seeking, such as, “adult day care Sacramento, California” or “Alzheimer’s disease support groups,” and you will usually get a number of options to choose from. If you do not succeed the first time, try changing the search terms, such as “respite care Sacramento California” or “caregiver support groups.”
One word of caution: as with any printed material, read with a healthy skepticism—just because it is on the Internet does not make it true. If in doubt, check the information with another independent resource and talk to your loved one’s doctor before proceeding, especially in regard to medications. Remember, just because a product is called “natural” or “herbal” does not mean it is harmless, particularly when mixed with other medications.
A number of caregiver resources are available to you—all you need to do is ask for help. You do not have to do it alone.",dementia

What makes this such an emotionally difficult turning point? Incontinence can be the last straw in a stressful caregiving situation. Covered below are some of the issues that make incontinence so difficult to deal with, and tips on how to cope with these concerns.",[]

An individual asked to use incontinence products daily may feel that they are no longer capable of taking care of themselves at the most basic level. Their response to you might be one of denial, anger, refusal, or passive inaction.
Coping: It is important to talk with your loved one in a calm, understanding, and honest way about how their incontinence is affecting you and your ability to provide the best possible care for them. This can make acceptance easier—of the incontinence as well as the incontinence products. If the care receiver lives with a mental or cognitive condition like dementia, learn the best approaches by taking a class or attending a support group where you can learn useful tools for more successful communication.
Be tactful; walking in and saying the house smells may offend the care receiver and cause a defensive response rather than one of cooperation.",[]

It’s hard to be responsible for caring for someone, like your parent, in this very personal and often invasive way. If you are caring for someone of the opposite sex, it can be awkward having to see, touch and care for their private areas. If you are caring for a parent of the same sex, it may still feel like you’re invading their privacy. And finally, there is compassion for the loss of dignity felt by a loved one who now needs care at this level.
Coping:  Talking it out with supportive family, friends, or professionals can be helpful. Acknowledge your uncomfortable feelings. Hire a home care worker or recruit another family member or friend to provide care when is too hard for you to do.        ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caring-someone-incontinence-emotional-and-social-issues/,Caring for Someone with Incontinence: Emotional and Social Issues,"Caregivers are often not at their best when dealing with incontinence. It might feel like the care receiver allowed an incontinence episode to occur on purpose to punish you. You might find yourself getting angry or impatient, especially if help is needed at an inconvenient time, such as when preparing dinner or sleeping. The cost of incontinence supplies can be a concern in the budget of the caregiver/care receiver. And if the care receiver is not cooperative, it puts even more strain on your relationship with them. Some people may also have physically reactions and discomfort to bodily fluids and odors. 
Coping: Admitting to your discomfort is a good first step. Pretending this is not an issue for you, if it is, only makes matters worse for both you and the care receiver.  Know that the care receiver is not trying to make your life harder; they have no control over what is happening. This is difficult for them, also. Seek out help through an in-person or online support groups, from a friend or family member who has had a similar experience, or from a social worker, nurse, occupational therapist or other health professional.

Coping: Acknowledge the many feeling you might have about dealing with incontinence and ask for help. Support groups, either in-person or online, can offer you both emotional encouragement and tried and true practical strategies. No doubt other caregivers will share their research and experience with various products. Get product recommendations from your doctor, pharmacist, or an occupational therapist.

Coping: If you are caring for someone with a physical disability, such as paralysis or weakness, make sure you have a physical therapist or occupational therapist teach you how to use your body so that you don’t hurt yourself while trying to help the care receiver. Work with your physician to make sure any plan of care includes what YOU need as well as what the care receiver needs. It’s OK to acknowledge your own limits and set limits when something might be harmful to you.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caring-someone-incontinence-emotional-and-social-issues/,Caring for Someone with Incontinence: Emotional and Social Issues,"Going out with someone who is incontinent takes some advanced planning. Caregivers and care receivers often become socially isolated because of concerns about dealing with incontinence outside of the home setting.
Coping: Prepack two small duffle or shoulder bags with everything you might need such as incontinence pads, wipes, gloves, change of underwear, and other supplies you require. Be sure to include a couple of plastic bag to stash soiled products. Keep one bag with you and one in the car, just in case. If traveling, look for a family/companion bathroom that allows two people to go in together. Or carry a laminated flyer that you can affix to the entrance of a public bathroom that says, for example, “wife caring for disabled husband inside.” Know that in some states, like California, a state law allows a family caregiver or paid attendant of either sex to assist a care receiver in a public bathroom. Arrange to have a seat near the bathroom in an airplane or on other transportation. Keep in mind where bathrooms are on an outing, which will reduce anxiety for both of you. Stop by a restroom frequently, even if the care receiver has not said they need to go. ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caring-someone-incontinence-emotional-and-social-issues/,Caring for Someone with Incontinence: Emotional and Social Issues,"Incontinence makes the caregiver’s job harder in many ways. Incontinence product leaks, their inconsistent usage, or even lack of use when called for, will result in more loads of laundry and more time consumed cleaning up the bathroom and around the house. Additional time is required if help is needed to bathe your loved one after a urine or bowel accident. As personal care takes more and more time, you may find yourself growing less patient and more frustrated. These feelings are only compounded if cleaning and bathing demands occur throughout the night leaving the caregiver without adequate sleep. Increasing time demands needed for incontinence care will influence when more help is needed, for example, recruiting another family member or hiring an attendant, and possibly considering whether it’s time to look into residential care placement. Additional factors that cannot be overlooked are the cost of incontinence care products, and the effort involved to monitor and purchase all necessary supplies. 
Coping: Hiring help can take some of the strain off of the caregiver. Many caregivers suggest searching online to find the best price for incontinence supplies and for finding coupons to help reduce the cost at the store. Don’t hesitate to ask another caregiver—in person or on an online caregiver support groups—for their suggestions on the best places to buy products. You may ultimately decide that placement is the best choice both for you and the care receiver—even if you promised never to move them to a nursing home. Then the caregiver can return to being a partner, adult child, friend, sibling and not only the personal care attendant. The change from loving partner to caregiver can result in grief, guilt and depression. Taking care of your own needs is most important in being able to care for someone else.   ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/caring-someone-incontinence-emotional-and-social-issues/,Caring for Someone with Incontinence: Emotional and Social Issues,"It will be easier for you, as a caregiver, as well as for the care receiver if you can make incontinence care as natural as possible. It is, after all, very common—25% of women and 15% of men experience incontinence at some point in their lives. Get a medical evaluation to see whether there is something that can be done to decrease the urgency of needing to use the bathroom, and to find out if a treatable condition can be identified, such as a urinary tract infection or prostate problem. Discuss with the care receiver’s physician whether medication or bladder training would be effective in this situation. Above all, seek out and get help from family, friends, and paid help if possible so it is not entirely on you to do all of the care.",[]

Ruth has been active at church and eats lunch at the local senior center a couple of times a week. Lisa does the food shopping, takes Ruth to doctors’ appointments, and has her over to her house for dinner, usually once a week.
Lisa has begun to notice, however, that when she is at her mother’s house, it is not as clean as it used to be. Several times lately she’s noticed a pile of dishes and a burned saucepan in the sink—something her mother would never have done before. The other day she saw a bright green envelope on the dining room table, which was a notice that the utility bill had not been paid.
Slowly, Lisa has begun to think that her mother may have problems with her memory, and may not be able to live safely at home alone any more. Having always been close to her mother, she had assumed that her mother would eventually come live with her. But now Lisa has to think about what that would mean.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/choosing-assistive-technology/,Choosing Assistive Technology,"Assistive Technology—also called assistive devices, independent living aids, and adaptive equipment—can help your loved one live more independently. It may also make your job as a caregiver easier and more enjoyable.
Assistive technology (AT) can be as simple as a hearing aid or cane, or as sophisticated as a voice-activated computer system or mechanical hoist to lift and turn someone in bed. Assistive technology devices are basically helpful products that improve a person’s ability to live and function independently. Some AT is considered “low-tech”–canes, magnifiers and pill organizers–while “high tech” assistive devices include computer applications, sensors and smart phone systems.
AT is a rapidly growing area and is used by people with disabilities and older adults who want to stay in their communities and remain independent as long as possible. More than 15 million Americans with disabilities use some type of AT. In a 2003 AARP survey of persons over 50, one-third of people reported using AT in their daily activities. The top three most popular AT devices were:
Walker, cane or crutches
Aids for bathing or toileting
Wheelchair or scooter.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/choosing-assistive-technology/,Choosing Assistive Technology,"The area of assistive technology has grown tremendously in recent years, and many manufacturers now provide a wide range of products and devices. It can be confusing, however, to determine which products might be right for your loved one. Here are a few basic tips to help you:
Focus on the actual tasks your loved one wants or needs to do when choosing devices. While this might seem obvious, it’s easy to get drawn into buying a product that looks good but doesn’t really address your loved one’s needs.
Generally, it is best to pick the simplest product available to meet the need. Simpler devices are often easier to use, less expensive, and easier to repair and maintain than more complex devices. For example, if someone does not have difficulty remembering to take their medications, but gets confused about which pills to take at which times, a weekly pill organizer that can be filled by a caregiver would solve the problem. Purchasing an automated pill dispenser with alarms to remind the person to take medications would be more complicated than necessary and would certainly be more expensive than the simpler pill organizer.
Ask experts that provide care to your loved one, like rehabilitation specialists, physical and occupational therapists, or adult day care staff, about which type of technology might be best.
Ask other people with disabilities what products they have found to be helpful.
Ask to use the device on a trial basis to see if it is truly going to meet your loved one’s needs.
Ultimately, your loved one’s opinion about a certain piece of AT is the most important. The device needs to be comfortable, attractive, and simple to use.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/choosing-assistive-technology/,Choosing Assistive Technology,"With so many vendors and manufacturers producing AT, it can be confusing to decide which products to buy. There are a few public agencies which keep a complete list of AT products and manufacturers and can help you find the right products for your loved one. Because these agencies do not sell equipment, they are a more trustworthy source of information than contacting manufacturers directly.
In addition to national programs, every state and territory has a State Technology Assistance Project that has information about AT, financial assistance to buy equipment and AT loan programs. ABLEDATA can connect you with someone in your state, or you can contact the agency (RESNA) which oversees the State Technology Assistance projects. (See Resources for AT).",[]

However, other independent living aids, like grab bars, bath mats and dressing aids, are typically not covered. The following funding sources and agencies may help you purchase certain kinds of aids:

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/communicating-your-doctor/,Communicating with Your Doctor,"When was the last time you left a doctor visit feeling satisfied that your concerns were heard and responded to? Successful communication with your doctor demands effective two-way communication. Here are a few tips to consider:
Make a list of your concerns. Start a few days in advance, if possible, to track symptoms or other concerns. Be thorough and honest; the details are important. Keeping the list to one page will help the doctor stay engaged. Mention your most important concerns first. Consider giving the doctor a copy of your list so she can follow along. This will help make the best use of the limited time you have for your appointment.
Speak up. Doctors tend to prioritize diagnostic information and core concerns early in the office visit. Make sure you make your key concerns known at the onset of the visit to help prevent the doctor from jumping to conclusions about treatments or dismissing issues you believe are important.
Listen. It is so easy to get rattled at a doctor’s visit that it sometimes feels like the appointment is over in a blink of an eye and all you walk out with is the blurred memory of a meeting and a prescription. Take some deep breaths and focus on what the doctor is saying. Bring a tape recorder and ask the doctor if she wouldn’t mind your recording the visit to help you better remember the information you discuss.
Ask questions. Don’t hesitate to ask when words the doctor is using are unfamiliar or his instructions are not clear to you. Question the assumptions behind proposed treatments that do not seem viable in your situation. And above all, you deserve to know what the cost to you may be for a proposed treatment. Doctors’ recommendations are only as valuable as your interest and ability to put them into practice.
Don’t minimize the symptoms or situation. Remarks like “it’s just a little cough” or “my mother being up all night really isn’t a problem,” might lead your doctor to the same conclusion. If your real fear is that your sister’s lung cancer started with a similar cough, let the doctor know. If mom’s being up all night is preventing you from getting any sleep, say so. A few reassuring words, an appropriate test or as-needed sleeping medication can put your mind at ease.
Share your knowledge. The doctor knows medical care and you know family care. Share information with the doctor about valuable community resources that have helped you. The doctor and their staff appreciate patient recommendations. They, in turn, can use this information to help other caregivers and patients.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/communication-dementia/,Communication (for dementia),"People respond to our body posture, facial expression, and tone of voice more than our actual words. Your upbeat mood can help keep the person you are dealing with remain calmer.
You need to pay attention to the non-verbal clues the person you are caring for is giving you. Understanding his/her feelings may be more important than the content of the conversation. Acknowledge feelings whenever possible.
Keep communication simple. Give one command at a time. Make eye contact before beginning to speak. Keep distractions to a minimum, for example turn off the TV or radio and stop background conversations, when you are interacting with someone with dementia.
A person with dementia may have trouble making a decision. Do not ask “What do you want for dinner?” but rather “Would you like spaghetti or hamburger for dinner?” Giving them a choice between two options can make meal planning easier for you and less frustrating for them.
Long explanations of why someone should do something are lost on a person with dementia. Their ability to follow your argument or to follow through on agreements is limited.
Arguing will increase agitation. Walk away and calm down, if possible, before continuing an interaction that leads to anger for you or your loved one.
Encourage the person by giving positive feedback often, especially for approximations of the desired behavior.
Sharing memories and reminiscing are a way to maintain interaction with someone with memory loss.
Agree with made up stories or explanations from the person with dementia. They do not need to be grounded in reality. Using a therapeutic lie or a “fiblet” can help you to gain cooperation, for example saying you are going out for ice cream but stopping by for a doctor’s appointment before the ice cream. Rewards work.
 Use distraction if someone is repeating a question over and over or retelling the same story.
If following your instructions is not working, model for the person what you want them to do. To start someone eating, pick up your fork, put another fork in the person’s hand, and start the eating process for yourself, encouraging him/her to do what you are doing.
Early in the illness, people often lose nouns, the names of objects. You can try and guess what they are saying or substitute the right word if you know it. Have the person point to or show you what he/she is talking about.
Call the person by name and identify yourself: “Hi Mom, it’s me, Mary.”

The trust spells out the conditions necessary for a trustee to take over. Another option is a Durable Power of Attorney for Asset Management, which delegates to an agent the power to make financial transactions on behalf of an individual if he/she is unable to do so himself. These transactions are not subject to court review.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/conservatorship-and-guardianship/,Conservatorship and Guardianship,"A conservatorship may be established after a relative, friend, or public official petitions the court for appointment of a conservator. The petition must contain information on why the individual cannot manage his or her financial affairs or make appropriate decisions concerning his or her personal care. Once a petition is filed with the court, a court investigator is appointed to interview the proposed conservatee and to determine if the individual is truly incapacitated and whether appointment of a conservator is justified. The investigator reports back to the court with an opinion.
Family and interested parties are notified of the proceedings and may testify in court.
The petition is set for hearing, and the conservatee must appear in court unless medically unable to do so. The judge determines, based on the petition, the investigator’s report, and any evidence taken during the hearing, whether or not the conservatorship is required, and what types of special powers may be granted to the conservator.

Outside of the cost of hiring an attorney, there are court filing fees, legal fees, investigator’s fees, and conservator’s fees. Returning to the court for approval of transactions requires additional attorney’s fees and can create delays in completing transactions. Professional conservators are paid out of the funds in the conservatee’s estate. If a family member has been appointed, he/she is also entitled to be paid an hourly fee for services performed.

The conservator must file an inventory that lists all the property of the conservatee and must file accountings with the court that reflect all transactions involving the conservatee’s assets. When a family is having trouble agreeing on what should be done, a conservator can be the neutral party whose only concern is the best interest of the individual.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/coping-behavior-problems-after-brain-injury/,Coping with Behavior Problems after Brain Injury,"People with brain injuries may experience a range of neuro­psychological problems following a traumatic brain injury. Depending on the part of the brain affected and the severity of the injury, the result for any one individual can vary greatly. Just as no two brains are alike, no two injuries are the same. Your loved one’s deficits following brain injury are completely unique, which makes a specific prognosis for recovery challenging.
Personality changes, memory and judgement deficits, lack of impulse control, and poor concentration are all common issues. Behavioral changes can be stressful for families and caregivers who must learn to adapt their communication techniques, reestablished relationships, and change expectations of what the impaired person can or cannot do.
In some cases, extended cognitive and behavioral rehabilitation in a residential or outpatient setting will be necessary to regain certain skills. A neuropsychologist also may be helpful in assessing cognitive deficits and behavioral issues. However, over the long term both the person with a brain injury and any involved family members will need to explore what combination of strategies work best for them to improve the functional and behavioral skills of the individual with a brain injury.",traumatic-brain-injury
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/coping-behavior-problems-after-brain-injury/,Coping with Behavior Problems after Brain Injury,"Even a person who makes a “good” recovery may go through some personality changes. Family members must be careful to avoid always comparing the impaired person with the way s/he “used to be.” Personality changes are often an exaggeration of the person’s pre-injury self, in which traits become intensified. Some changes can be quite striking. It may be, for example, that the person with a brain injury used to be easygoing, energetic, and thoughtful and now seems easily angered, self-absorbed, and unable to show enthusiasm for anything. Nonetheless, try not to criticize or make fun of the person’s deficits. This is sure to make the person feel frustrated, angry, or embarrassed. Always try keep in mind that the behavior of the person with a brain injury – although seemingly willful or intentional − is not fully in their control due to damaged brain cells.",traumatic-brain-injury
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/coping-behavior-problems-after-brain-injury/,Coping with Behavior Problems after Brain Injury,"People with brain injuries may experience short-term memory problems and/or amnesia related to certain periods of time. In general, pre-injury knowledge is more easily retained. In contrast, new learning presents the greatest challenge to memory or remembering. Consistent repetition of new information, or repeated engagement in an activity, is most helpful to enable the person to retain the learning. Real-time learning (or learning about something when you need it) − with an actual problem and consequences − is much more meaningful than discussion about a problem or situation.
The ability to focus and concentrate are keys to addressing some short-term memory problems.
Keep distractions (e.g., music, noise) to a minimum. Focus on only one task at a time. Give one command at a time.
if memory impairment is severe, without condescending, have the individual repeat the name of a person or object after you.
Whenever possible, have the person write down key information (e.g., appointments, phone messages, list of chores).
Keep to routines. Keep household objects in the same place. Use the same route to walk to the mailbox or bus stop. Changes in environment or routines are much more disruptive to the person with a brain injury as they work to accommodate new information.
If getting lost is a problem, you can label or color-code doors or hang arrows to indicate directions. When going out, the person should be accompanied initially to ensure the route is understood and can be repeated. A simple map can be sketched from the bus stop to the house.

This may be especially present during the earlier stages of recovery.
Try not to take it personally if the person does not show an appropriate response. Above all, always remember this is not willful or consciously directed at you, even though it may seem that way. It is a consequence of the injury to the brain and its functional ability.

Such overreactions can be sudden tears, angry outbursts, or laughter. It is important to understand that the person has lost some control over emotional responses. The key to handling emotional lability is recognizing that the behavior is unintentional.
Caregivers should model calm behavior and try not to provoke further stress by responding in-kind, being overly critical, arguing or demanding. Be in the person’s world first. Then work to gently bridge the gap to help him/her recognize what is currently happening in the moment. The key is to help the person relearn behavior (or modifications to that behavior). It’s important to remember that relearning behavior or behavior with modifications is not actually “relearning”, since these behaviors are now new. Work to support/reinforce the techniques that produce emotional responses which are under the person’s control, while respecting their current feelings. Seek out the help of a neuropsychologist if emotional behaviors become too stressful, problematic, aggressive or violent.",traumatic-brain-injury
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/coping-behavior-problems-after-brain-injury/,Coping with Behavior Problems after Brain Injury,"Provided a situation does not present a physical threat, there are various approaches to diffuse hostile behavior.
Remain as calm as you can; ignore the behavior.
Try to change the person’s mood by agreeing with the person (if appropriate) and thus avoiding an argument. Show extra affection and support to address underlying frustrations.
Validate the emotion by identifying the feelings and letting the person know these feelings are legitimate. Frustration over the loss of functional and/or cognitive abilities can reasonably provoke anger.
Do not challenge or confront the person. Rather, negotiate − e.g., if you don’t like what’s planned for dinner tonight, how about choosing Friday’s menu?
Offer alternative ways to express anger − e.g., a punching bag, a “gripe” list.
Try to understand the source of the anger. Is there a way to address the person’s need/frustration? Perhaps it can be redirected by making a phone call or choosing an alternative activity.
Help the person regain a sense of control by asking if there is anything that would help him/her feel better.
If necessary, isolate a disruptive person. Consider your own safety and his/hers. Treat each incident as a single occurrence, as the person with a brain injury may not remember having acted this way before or may need to be gently prompted to remember the previous behavior. Try to establish consistent, non-confrontational responses from all family members. For example, children may need to learn some “dos” and “don’ts” in reacting to the person with a brain injury.
Seek support for yourself as a caregiver. Consult a neuropsychologist, attend a support group, and/or seek personal counseling. If necessary, protective services or law enforcement may need to be contacted.",traumatic-brain-injury
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/coping-behavior-problems-after-brain-injury/,Coping with Behavior Problems after Brain Injury,"The person who has survived a brain injury may lack empathy. That is, some people with brain injuries have difficulty seeing things through someone else’s eyes. The result can be thoughtless or hurtful remarks or unreasonable demanding requests. This behavior stems from a lack of abstract thinking.
Help cue the person to recognize thoughtlessness. Remind him/her to practice polite behavior. Realize that awareness of other people’s feelings – and even basic, social behavior we take for granted − may have to be relearned by the person with a brain injury. Again, even if hurtful personally, understand this behavior is not willful but a result of injury to the brain.",traumatic-brain-injury
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/coping-behavior-problems-after-brain-injury/,Coping with Behavior Problems after Brain Injury,"“Cueing” or reminders can be helpful in improving concentration and attention. Check to see if the person is tired, anxious or upset which greatly effects cognitive performance. Ask simple questions and repeat if necessary. Don’t provide too much information at once. Get in the habit of always breaking thoughts or information down into easily comprehensible pieces.
People with brain injuries should be encouraged to develop self-checks by asking themselves questions such as “Did I understand everything, did I write it down, and is this what I’m supposed to be doing?” “I made a mistake,” or “I’m not sure,” should lead to the conclusion, “Let me slow down and concentrate so I can adjust my actions or behavior.” Correct actions should be consciously praised, “I did a good job.” Consistent repetition of self-checking will help to modify behavior more permanently.",traumatic-brain-injury
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/coping-behavior-problems-after-brain-injury/,Coping with Behavior Problems after Brain Injury,"It is relatively common for a person with a brain injury to be unaware of his/her deficits. Remember that this is a part of the neurological damage and not just obstinacy. Be aware, however, that denial can also be a coping mechanism to conceal the fear of lost functioning in the brain or that s/he cannot do a particular task. The person may insist that the activity cannot be done or is perhaps “stupid.”
Build self-esteem by encouraging the person to try a (non-dangerous) activity that s/he feels confident doing.
Give the person visual and verbal reminders or “hints” − e.g., a smile or the words “good job”− to improve confidence in carrying out basic activities more independently. Be careful not to condescend. If you feel the person can handle confrontation, challenge him/her to try the activity.",traumatic-brain-injury
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/coping-behavior-problems-after-brain-injury/,Coping with Behavior Problems after Brain Injury,"After a brain injury, a person may experience either increased or decreased interest in sex. The causes could be a result of brain regulation of hormonal activity or an emotional response to the injury, or both.
Sexual disinterest from a spouse with a brain injury should not be taken personally. Avoiding sexual contact could stem from fear or embarrassment about potential performance. Do not pressure the person to resume sexual activity before s/he is ready. Helping the person dress nicely and practice good hygiene may help increase his/her confidence in feeling attractive.
Increased sexual interest can be particularly stressful and embarrassing to families and caregivers. Without good impulse control, the person with a brain injury may make crude remarks out in public, make a pass at a married friend, try to touch someone in an inappropriate setting, or demand sexual attention from a spouse or significant other.
It is very important to be consistent in reminding the person that certain behaviors are not acceptable. Consistent, positive reinforcement is key to reestablishing boundaries.
A spouse should not feel pressured into submitting to sexual demands that are unwanted.
A sexually aggressive person may need to be isolated from others when inappropriate behavior is not controlled. Consultation with a neuropsychologist may be necessary, or a caregiver (spouse, or other family member) may need to call for help if physical threats are made. Consult with a physician if this is an ongoing problem as there may be medication that can help.
Support groups may be useful in helping the person realize the consequences of inappropriate sexual behaviors.",traumatic-brain-injury
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/coping-behavior-problems-after-brain-injury/,Coping with Behavior Problems after Brain Injury,"Coping with behavior problems after a brain injury requires identification and acknowledgment of the deficits of the individual with a brain injury. A comprehensive neuropsychological assessment is recommended. This will help both the person with a brain injury and the family to better understand neurological and cognitive deficits and behavioral issues. The neuropsychological evaluation provides trained rehabilitation professionals − neuropsychologists, psychologists, speech and occupational therapists – with a “map” of where compensatory strategies and behavior modification should be directed. Oftentimes families or caregivers can recognize personality changes and cognitive deficits but find it difficult to resolve the issues. A treatment plan developed from a neuropsychological evaluation can more efficiently uncover deficits and enable professionals to help the person and their caregivers resolve them.
Finally, it is critical that family members seek and receive support from other family members, friends, support group, and/or counselor as they deal with their own emotional responses to caring for a person with a brain injury.",traumatic-brain-injury

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/frontotemporal-dementia-checklist/,Could It Be Their Brain? A Frontotemporal Dementia Checklist,"Symptoms of brain-related disorders are often misunderstood. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is especially challenging. As a result of this disorder, family members and friends may sense that the person has changed, but they can’t put their finger on the cause. They may find that a person is being thoughtless or no longer cares about them. Resulting feelings of anger and sadness may lead typically supportive family or friends to distance themselves at a time when the person with the disorder needs them most. It is important to understand that people with these disorders cannot control their behaviors and other symptoms.
If your relative or friend is acting in a way that doesn’t seem normal to you, it could possibly be due to FTD. If they are exhibiting the symptoms below, help them find a local expert to test for frontotemporal disorders. Following are a list of symptoms that someone with FTD may be experiencing:
Trouble thinking through a sequence of steps (what comes first, second, third, and so on) and prioritizing those steps.
Multitasking becomes challenging when they could do so previously (managing more than one activity at a time, shifting from one to another as needed or desired).
Behaving in an embarrassing or unusual way such as when a person with an easygoing nature suddenly becomes aggressive, highly critical, or acts out in a way that is unusual for them.
Acting out of sync with the situation or misreading social cues, such as laughing when hearing sad news or no reaction during a celebration.
Repeating the same activity or phrase over and over, asking the same question repeatedly, despite receiving an answer.
Compulsive eating like gorging on food, especially sweet and starchy foods like bread and cookies. Someone with FTD may take food from other people’s plates or may only want to eat the same food for every meal.
Having difficulty resisting impulses to use or touch objects. For example grabbing someone else’s car keys or eating fruit at the grocery store before it is purchased.
Language difficulty either in using and understanding words (aphasia) and/or in the physical ability to speak (dysarthria).
Appearing apathetic, showing an unusual lack of interest in, or initiation of an activity, especially ones he or she previously enjoyed. This can seem like depression, but people with apathy may not be sad.
Lacking insight (anosognosia) into their behaviors that are quite obvious to others, as well as how they are affecting others around them. This lack of awareness is hard for caregivers to deal with because the person may reject efforts to help.
“Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a group of related conditions resulting from the progressive degeneration of the temporal and frontal lobes of the brain. These areas of the brain play a significant role in decision-making, behavioral control, emotion and language” (UCSF Memory & Aging Center). Fortunately there is growing awareness of this devastating disease. Early detection can help the person living with the disorder to find treatment sooner. A diagnosis will hasten the ability of family and friend caregivers to gain valuable information and compassion for their loved one and for themselves.",dementia

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-driving/,Dementia and Driving,"When an individual is diagnosed with dementia, one of the first concerns that families and caregivers face is whether or not that person should drive. A diagnosis of dementia may not mean that a person can no longer drive safely. In the early stages of dementia, some—though not all—individuals may still possess skills necessary for safe driving. Most dementia, however, is progressive, meaning that symptoms such as memory loss, visual-spatial disorientation, and decreased cognitive function will worsen over time. This also means that a person’s driving skills will decrease and, eventually, he or she will have to give up driving. Many people associate driving with self-reliance and freedom; the loss of driving privileges is likely to be upsetting. Some individuals, recognizing the risks, will limit or stop driving on their own. Others may be unable to assess their own driving skills and may insist on driving even when it is no longer safe. Families and caregivers may have to intervene when an individual’s symptoms pose too great a traffic risk.
Because the progression of dementia varies from person to person, it is difficult to know at what point an individual can no longer drive safely. This fact sheet provides guidelines to help caregivers and persons with dementia decide when and how to limit or stop driving.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-driving/,Dementia and Driving,"As a general rule, individuals with early stage or mild dementia who wish to continue driving should have their driving skills evaluated immediately (see “Arrange for an Independent Driving Evaluation” below). Individuals with moderate or severe dementia should not drive.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-driving/,Dementia and Driving,"You can assess an individual’s level of functioning by observing his or her day-to-day behavior outside of a motor vehicle. Following are some signs that a person no longer has the necessary skills to drive safely. He or she:
Has become less coordinated.
Has difficulty judging distance and space.
Gets lost or feels disoriented in familiar places.
Has difficulty engaging in multiple tasks.
Has increased memory loss, especially for recent events.
Is less alert to things happening around him or her.
Has mood swings, confusion, irritability.
Needs prompting for personal care.
Has difficulty processing information.
Has difficulty with decision-making and problem solving.
It is important to compare present behavior with behavior before the onset of dementia. For example, weigh an individual’s degree of “difficulty engaging in multiple tasks” in relation to his or her prior ability. Changes in behavior will be most noticeable to family and friends who have closely interacted with the individual over time. Share and discuss your observations with other family members, friends, and health care providers.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-driving/,Dementia and Driving,"The safest option for assessing a person’s driving skills is to arrange for an independent driving evaluation. Prior to the evaluation, inform the examiners that the person being evaluated has dementia. Evaluations are sometimes available through driver rehabilitation programs or State Departments of Motor Vehicles (DMV).
Although laws vary from state to state, some states require physicians to notify the DMV of any patient diagnosed with dementia. The person with dementia may then be required to report to the DMV for a behind-the-wheel driver re-examination. In some states, individuals diagnosed with moderate or severe dementia may have their licenses automatically revoked. To find out about driving and dementia laws, you can call the Department of Motor Vehicles for the state in which the individual resides.
Because symptoms of dementia are likely to worsen over time, individuals who pass a driving evaluation should continue to be re-evaluated every six months. Individuals who do not pass must discontinue driving immediately.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-driving/,Dementia and Driving,"If an individual clearly demonstrates that he or she can drive safely, it is still important for family and friends to continue monitoring the individual’s driving behavior, as the individual’s driving skills may decrease significantly in a short period of time. The objective of monitoring is to detect a problem before it becomes a crisis. If there are any doubts about safety, the person with dementia should not be driving.
It is often helpful to keep a written log of each incident of poor driving behavior. Following are some of the common warning signs.
Drives too slowly.
Stops in traffic for no reason or ignores traffic signs.
Becomes lost on a familiar route.
Lacks good judgment.
Has difficulty with turns, lane changes, or highway exits.
Drifts into other lanes of traffic or drives on the wrong side of the street.
Signals incorrectly or does not signal.
Has difficult seeing pedestrians, objects, or other vehicles.
Falls asleep while driving or gets drowsy.
Parks inappropriately.
Gets ticketed for traffic violations.
Is increasingly nervous or irritated when driving.
Has accidents, near misses, or “fender benders.”
Discuss any concerns you have with the individual, family members, and health care providers. All involved will need to weigh potential risks and decide when the individual needs to stop.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-driving/,Dementia and Driving,"You can also estimate an individual’s potential for a traffic accident by taking the person along as a passenger and asking him or her to co-pilot. Ask the person to give you specific instructions about using blinkers, changing lanes, and following the rules of the road. If he or she has difficulty or becomes frustrated easily, it may be time for another independent driving evaluation.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-driving/,Dementia and Driving,"Some individuals are aware of having difficulty with driving and are relieved when others encourage them to stop. Many people, however, will find the loss of driving privileges and the inherent loss of independence upsetting. Encourage the individual with dementia to talk about how this change might make him or her feel. Try to imagine what it would be like if you could no longer drive. Support groups provide a good venue for both the caregivers and the individual to talk about their feelings and get advice from others in a similar situation. A person often adjusts better if he or she is involved in discussions and decisions about when to stop driving.
If the individual is reluctant to talk about driving, ask the individual’s physician or care manager to bring up the subject of driving during health care visits. A lawyer or financial planner may also be willing to discuss driving as part of the individual’s legal and financial planning.
Begin discussions early and try to establish guidelines about when and how to limit, and eventually stop, driving. Try to reach an agreement regarding which types of driving behavior would signal the need to stop driving. Each family will need to find the solutions that work best in their situation.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-driving/,Dementia and Driving,"Because the progression of dementia varies, individuals who have demonstrated the ability to drive safely should still begin gradually to modify their driving. This can reduce the risk of an accident if the individual’s driving skills decrease significantly between evaluations. Making the transition from driver to passenger over time can help ease the adjustment. Encourage individuals to try some of the following examples:
Drive only on familiar roads and avoid long distances.
Avoid heavy traffic and heavily traveled roads.
Avoid driving at night and in bad weather.

Arrange for a barber or hairdresser to make home visits.
Invite friends and family over for regular visits.
Arrange for family and friends to take the individual on social outings.
 ",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-driving/,Dementia and Driving,"It will be important to make alternative transportation arrangements so that the individual’s mobility and activity level are not unduly restricted. Commonly used transportation options are:
Family and Friends. Family members, friends, and neighbors can offer to drive the individual to social engagements and appointments. Consider making a list with the names, phone numbers, and times of availability of those willing to provide transportation.
Public Transportation. For individuals in the early stage of dementia, public transportation may be a good alternative to driving. It works best for those who are already familiar with the public transportation system in their area. Persons in the later stages of dementia may not be able to figure out routes and schedules.
Taxis. For individuals in the early to middle stages of dementia who do not have behavior problems, taxis can be a good option if someone meets the individual at both ends of the taxi ride. You may be able to set up a payment account with the taxi company so that the individual with dementia does not have to handle money.
Senior and Special Needs Transportation Services. The Yellow Pages of many telephone books have a special section in the front with the names and addresses of various service organizations. Look under transportation or community services for the names of agencies that provide transportation for special needs.

However, some individuals with dementia may forget that they should not drive or insist on driving even though it is no longer safe. While it is important to maintain respect for the individual’s feelings, you must put safety first.
As a last resort, you may have to prevent his or her access to a car. Some methods to do that include:
Hiding the car keys.
Replacing the car keys with a set that won’t start the car.
Disabling or selling the car.
Moving the car out of sight.

This gives you time to look at the situation more objectively and to choose how to respond in a more controlled way.
When you feel yourself becoming frustrated, try counting from one to ten slowly and taking a few deep breaths. If you are able, take a brief walk or go to another room and collect your thoughts. It is better to leave the situation, even for a moment, than to lose control or react in a way you will regret. If you think someone may be offended when you leave the room, you can tell that person you need to go to the restroom. You can also try calling a friend, praying, meditating, singing, listening to music, or taking a bath. Try experimenting with different responses to find out what works best for you and the person you care for.
The regular practice of relaxation techniques can also help prepare you for frustrating circumstances. If possible, try the following relaxation exercise for at least ten minutes each day:
Sit in a comfortable position in a quiet place. Take slow, deep breaths and relax the tension in your body. While you continue to take slow, deep breaths, you may want to imagine a safe and restful place and repeat a calming word or phrase.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-caregiving-and-controlling-frustration/,"Dementia, Caregiving, and Controlling Frustration","As you take time out to collect your thoughts, try rethinking your situation in ways that reduce frustration. How you think often affects how you feel. Of course, feelings of frustration arise from difficult circumstances. If, however, you analyze your response to a frustrating situation, you will usually find some form of maladaptive—or negative—thinking that has the effect of increasing your frustration, preventing you from looking at your situation objectively, or finding a better way to deal with it.
Below are six major types of unhelpful thought patterns common among caregivers. Following each unhelpful thought pattern is an example of an adaptive—or more helpful—thought that can be used as self-defense against frustration.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-caregiving-and-controlling-frustration/,"Dementia, Caregiving, and Controlling Frustration","You reach a conclusion without having all the facts. You might do this in two ways:
Mindreading: We assume that others are thinking negative thoughts about us. For example, a friend doesnʼt return a phone call, and we assume that he or she is ignoring us or doesnʼt want to talk to us.
Adaptive response: “I donʼt know what my friend is thinking. For all I know, she didnʼt get the message. Maybe she is busy or just forgot. If I want to know what she is thinking, I will have to ask her.”
  Fortune-telling: You predict a negative outcome in the future. For example, you will not try adult day care because you assume the person in your care will not enjoy it. You think, “He will never do that. Not a chance!”
Adaptive response: “I cannot predict the future. I donʼt think he is going to like it, but I wonʼt know for sure unless I try.”",dementia

Using the “Triple-Column Technique”
Unhelpful thought patterns are usually ingrained reactions or habits. To modify your negative thoughts, you will have to learn to recognize them, know why they are false, and talk back to them.
One helpful way to practice using more adaptive thinking processes is to use the “triple-column technique.” Draw two lines down the center of a piece of paper to divide the paper into thirds. When you are feeling frustrated, take a personal “time out” and write your negative thoughts in the first column.
In the second column, try to identify the type of unhelpful pattern from the six examples above. In the third column, talk back to your negative thoughts with a more positive point of view. See below for examples.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-caregiving-and-controlling-frustration/,"Dementia, Caregiving, and Controlling Frustration","Good communication can reduce frustration by allowing you to express yourself while helping others to understand your limits and needs. Assertive communication is different from passive or aggressive communication. When you communicate passively, you may be keeping your own needs and desires inside to avoid conflict with others. While this may seem easier on the surface, the long-term result may be that others feel they can push you around to get their way.
When you communicate aggressively, you may be forcing your needs and desires onto others. While this allows you to express your feelings, aggressive communication generally makes others more defensive and less cooperative.
When you communicate assertively, you express your own needs and desires while respecting the needs and desires of others. Assertive communication allows both parties to engage in a dignified discussion about the issue at hand.
Keys to assertive communication are:
Respecting your own feelings, needs, and desires.
Standing up for your feelings without shaming, degrading, or humiliating the other person.
Using “I” statements rather than “you” statements. For example, say, “I need a break” or “I would like to talk to you and work this out” instead of “You are irresponsible” or “You never help out!”
Not using “should” statements. For example, say, “Itʼs important to me that promises be kept,” instead of “You should keep your promise.”",dementia

People will not realize you need help if you do not explain your situation and ask for assistance. Remember, you have the right to ask for help and express your needs.
When to say “Yes”
Donʼt be afraid to say “Yes” if someone offers to help. Say “Yes” at the moment a person offers to help rather than saying “Maybe” and waiting until you are in a fix. Have a list handy of errands or tasks you need help with. Keep in mind that people feel useful and gratified when they are able to help others.
When to say “No”
Often, caregivers are pulled in multiple directions. In addition to the demands of caregiving, you may feel compelled to meet the demands of your immediate and extended family, your friends, and your employer. Learn how to say “No” to the demands of others when you are overwhelmed or need a break. It is your right to say “No” to extra demands on your time without feeling guilty.",dementia

They do not need to be corrected or grounded in “reality.” You can distract them or just agree with them as a way to reduce your frustration.
It can be helpful, however, to learn more about dementia and effective communication techniques which will ease your frustration. For example, use simple, direct statements, and place yourself close when speaking to a person with a cognitive disorder. Try not to argue about unimportant things such as what the date is.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-driving-and-california-state-law/,"Dementia, Driving, and California State Law","Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease or a related disorder become progressively impaired in their ability to drive. Symptoms such as memory loss, disorientation, and changes in visual and spatial perception may result in an individual’s getting lost, forgetting the “rules of the road,” or having slowed reaction times. While a person with early dementia may not appear to have these problems, the disease may eventually affect his or her motor coordination, judgment, and concentration. Furthermore, at all phases of impairment, driving ability is likely to worsen during times of high stress.
It is not uncommon for individuals with dementia and their families to have differing opinions on the individual’s driving ability. However, while respecting the individual’s desire to drive, family members must put safety first. When it is clear that a person cannot drive safely, family members should not hesitate to act accordingly. Resisting the loss of independence, some people with dementia may insist on continuing to drive even when their licenses are revoked. This would have obvious legal implications for the individual and family in the unfortunate event of an accident. As a last resort, caregivers and family members may need to prevent access to the vehicle. For example, the car may need to be “disabled” or moved to an unknown location, or the keys may need to be taken away or hidden. A letter from the attending physician recommending against continued driving may also be shown to the individual.
Some persons with dementia are aware of having difficulty with driving and are relieved when others encourage them to stop. However, the loss of driving privileges is likely to be upsetting.
Caregivers and family members should be respectful and open with the individual. The loss of independence associated with driving can make a person feel vulnerable, and he or she may be reluctant to discuss discontinuing the use of a motor vehicle.
Asking physicians, care managers, and other health professionals to bring up the subject of driving in their discussions with the individual can help to initiate a dialogue. Support groups also provide a good place for both caregivers and individuals with dementia to voice their concerns and receive advice from others in a similar situation. State regulations provide specific guidelines to determine driving capabilities.
 ",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-driving-and-california-state-law/,"Dementia, Driving, and California State Law","California’s Health & Safety Code [Section 103900] requires physicians to submit a confidential report to the county health department when an individual is diagnosed as having Alzheimer’s disease or related disorders, including dementia, severe enough to impair a person’s ability to operate a motor vehicle. This information is forwarded to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), which is authorized to take action against the driving privileges of any individual who is unable to safely operate a motor vehicle. If the physician’s report indicates that an individual has moderate or severe dementia, that individual will no longer be permitted to operate a motor vehicle. DMV has determined that only drivers with dementia in the mild stages may still have the cognitive functions necessary to continue driving safely. DMV requires re-examination for all individuals reported to have mild dementia.
The California DMV follows specific procedures when a medical report is received:
A computer search is conducted to locate the individual’s name, verify that he/she has a license, and examine the driving record.
The individual is contacted by letter and sent a “Driver Medical Evaluation” form to authorize his/her primary physician to submit medical information about the status of the dementia to DMV.
A Driver Safety hearing officer reviews the medical form. If the documentation reveals that the dementia is in the mild stage, the individual is scheduled for a re-examination with DMV. If the individual has moderate or severe dementia, driving privileges will be revoked. If the individual fails to submit medical documentation within the requested time frame, all driving privileges will be suspended.
A re-examination is completed, involving three phases: a visual test, a written test, and an interview.",dementia

Written Test: The individual is given the standard DMV written examination designed to test a person’s knowledge of the road. The written test allows DMV to determine not only the individual’s knowledge of driving laws, but more importantly, the individual’s mental competency and cognitive skills.
Interview: The in-person interview focuses on the medical documentation as well as the driver’s ability to coherently answer questions about his or her health, medical treatment, driving record, need to drive, daily routine, need for assistance with daily activities, etc. Persons who do well up to this point are then given a driving test. Those who do poorly on the visual, written, or verbal tests may have their driving privilege suspended or revoked.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-driving-and-california-state-law/,"Dementia, Driving, and California State Law","The driving test is designed to test driving skills that might be affected by mild dementia. For instance, the first thing observed is whether the individual can find his/her car. Then, the examiner gives a series of commands, rather than one direction at a time (for example, “Please drive to the corner, turn left, and turn right at the first street”). The test generally lasts longer than the ordinary driver’s test in order to gauge whether or not fatigue is a problem.
If the individual passes the driving test, the license is generally not suspended or revoked. However, restrictions may be imposed on the license, such as no freeway driving, no night driving, or driving allowed only within a certain radius. DMV may want to review the individual’s driving skills again in six to twelve months. At that time the entire process begins again.
An appeals process is available if the individual or family wishes to contest the suspension or revocation of the driver’s license. At the hearing the individual must present evidence, such as new medical information, to prove that the dementia does not impair his or her ability to safely operate a motor vehicle.
DMV can provide a California identification card to those persons who will no longer have a driver’s license.
In lieu of a physician’s report, a family member may submit a written referral to the Regional Driver Safety Office, requesting that DMV re-examine the driving ability of an individual with dementia. DMV has the authority to re-examine drivers who have been reported to be unsafe, and, alternatively, to take immediate action if the driver appears to be an immediate safety risk.
As of January 2001, Senate Bill 335 (SB 335) specifically requires DMV to conduct a re-examination, including a behind-the-wheel driving test, upon receipt of notification from the driver’s spouse or a family member within “three degrees of consanguinity” (no more than a third generation of blood relationship). The person must submit the report in writing and may not report the same family member more than one time during a twelve-month period. The family member completing the report is not required to report his or her name but must identify the family relationship. The report must be based upon personal observation, evidence of a physical or medical condition that may impair safe driving, or upon personal knowledge of traffic citations or other evidence indicating unsafe driving. The report must be filed in good faith and with reasonable knowledge that the driver cannot safely operate a motor vehicle. SB 335 does not preclude other family members (outside three degrees of consanguinity) from referring a driver. However, other family members must sign the referral. DMV will not act upon anonymous referrals other than those authorized by SB 335. If confidentiality is requested, DMV will honor this request to the extent possible under the law. All referrals should also include the full name of the driver, his or her license number (if known), date of birth, and current address. DMV is required to give ten days written notice of the time and place for re-examination. If the driver refuses the re-examination or fails to complete the re-examination, DMV is required to suspend or revoke all driving privileges until re-examination is completed. If it appears that the driver presents an immediate safety risk, DMV could take immediate action in lieu of re-examination.
DMV has separate requirements and guidelines for drivers with other cognitive disorders (e.g., stroke, head injury, epilepsy). For further information regarding driving regulations, dementia and cognitive impairments, call your local DMV for the number of your Regional Driver Safety Office, or contact the Post-Licensing Policy Unit in the Sacramento DMV (www.dmv.ca.gov/(800) 777-0133). Laws pertaining to driving and dementia are subject to change.

It is important for the person with dementia to maintain interaction with friends and family. Caregivers can invite friends and family over for regular visits and, if possible, arrange social outings for the individual with dementia. Caregivers and family members should keep in mind the individual’s personality in discussing and devising a plan to limit or discontinue the individual’s driving. It is not unusual to encounter great resistance to any limitations on driving. But safety must be the primary concern.

For many people, the term carries with it frightening associations.
In fact, dementia is a group of symptoms, personality changes, or unusual behavior. These can include:
short-term memory loss
confusion
inability to problem-solve
inability to complete multi-step activities (preparing a meal, or balancing a checkbook)
Saying that someone has dementia recognizes these changes in the person, but it says nothing about why they have these symptoms. It doesn’t explain the cause.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/is-this-dementia-what-does-it-mean/,Dementia: Is This Dementia and What Does It Mean?,"Does any loss of memory signify dementia? Isn’t memory loss a normal part of aging — something we should all expect?
Acknowledging memory changes in a friend or family member can be difficult. It’s not uncommon to claim it’s a normal part of aging as a way to minimize what it may mean to your family. In truth, we know that serious memory loss is not a normal part of aging, and none of us should ignore or downplay it.
For some of us, the tendency may be to the other extreme — jumping to the conclusion that the friend or family member has Alzheimer’s disease. Sometimes (but not always), it is Alzheimer’s.
But other conditions share those symptoms. They also cause memory and cognitive problems that interfere with daily activities. Some affect younger as well as older people.",dementia

Medication interactions, depression, vitamin deficiencies, and thyroid abnormalities all can cause temporary bouts of dementia or delirium. Luckily, with early identification, the appropriate treatment can actually reverse these cases.
Irreversible dementias are degenerative, and Alzheimer’s disease is the most common. Other degenerative dementias may look like Alzheimer’s, but they have distinct features that need special attention and a variety of treatments.
With the many causes of dementia — and each one’s respective treatment – we can see why a clear and timely diagnosis is critical.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/is-this-dementia-what-does-it-mean/,Dementia: Is This Dementia and What Does It Mean?,"The diagnosis of dementia requires a complete medical and neuropsychological evaluation. The process first determines whether the person has a cognitive problem and how severe it is. After diagnosis and uncovering the cause, the doctor can recommend treatment. And patients and caregivers can plan for the future.
A medical evaluation for dementia usually has several parts.
Review of history or onset of symptoms
Clinicians may ask you or the person you care for questions such as:
What problems have you observed or identified?
In what order did these changes happen?
How long have the symptoms been present?
How is this affecting the person’s ability to function in daily life?
The patient may be unable to recall the sequence of events or severity of the problem. That’s why a caregiver or someone who knows the individual must go with the patient and provide this information to the care team.
Medical history and medications
Medical history details may identify increased risk for a particular type of dementia. A review of medications helps clinicians flag specific drugs or drug interactions that can contribute to cognitive problems. Again, it’s crucial that someone who can accurately provide this information be with the individual during the appointment.
Neurological exam
Neurological exams look for symptoms that may indicate specific kinds of dementia or other conditions, such as stroke or Parkinson’s disease, that have an increased risk of cognitive problems.
Laboratory tests
Your physician will want to rule out a possible vitamin deficiency, infection, or hormone imbalance – all of which can cause cognitive symptoms. Examples of these include:
Thyroid imbalances
Vitamin B12 deficiency
Syphilis
Common chronic conditions like high cholesterol and high blood pressure put a person at risk of developing dementia. The doctor may order other lab tests to screen for this risk.
Brain imaging
A CT scan or MRI evaluates the anatomy of the brain for conditions that might cause cognitive changes, such as a brain tumor or stroke. The imaging tests can also serve as a starting point or historical reference for brain size and blood vessel changes monitored over time.
Mental status testing
Also known as neuropsychological exams, these pencil-and-paper questionnaires test many areas of cognition:
Memory
Language
Problem-solving
Judgment
The care team compares the test results with those of patients with similar age, education, and ethnicity. That helps identify the relative frequency and severity of the issues experienced.",dementia

A clear diagnosis is imperative.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/is-this-dementia-what-does-it-mean/,Dementia: Is This Dementia and What Does It Mean?,"In elderly people, a variety of diseases and disorders can cause cognitive functioning to deteriorate. An illness or a reaction to medication may cause a change in mental status. These are sometimes called “pseudodementias.” A medical evaluation may determine if a dementia is reversible or treatable.
Conditions and circumstances can cause reversible symptoms of dementia:
Reactions to medications
One common reason older people experience dementia-like symptoms is an adverse drug reaction.
The physician should monitor all medications, prescriptions, over-the-counter remedies, and herbal supplements to reduce possible side effects.
Endocrine abnormalities
Low or high thyroid levels, parathyroid disturbances, or adrenal abnormalities all can cause confusion that can resemble dementia.
Metabolic disturbances
Renal and liver failure, electrolyte imbalances (blood chemistry levels), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), hypercalcemia (high calcium), and diseases of the liver and pancreas — they all can cause confusion and changes to appetite, sleep, and emotions.
Emotional distress
Depression or major life changes such as retirement, divorce, or loss of a friend or family member can affect one’s physical and mental health.
It’s important to inform the physician about major life events that could cause stress.
Vision and hearing
Undetected problems of vision or hearing may result in inappropriate responses — and could be misinterpreted.
The care team should perform hearing and eye exams to identify any issues.
Infections
Confusion can be a symptom of an infection.
Bring any signs of confusion to the attention of the physician.
Nutritional deficiencies
Deficiencies of B vitamins (folate, niacin, riboflavin, and thiamine) can produce cognitive impairment.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/is-this-dementia-what-does-it-mean/,Dementia: Is This Dementia and What Does It Mean?,"If diagnostics rule out reversible dementias and the care team determines that the person has a degenerative or irreversible dementia, it is important that families and medical personnel seek the cause of the problem.
This helps ensure the person affected receives proper medical care. It also enables families to plan their caregiving and find support and resources.
Here are the most common degenerative dementias:
Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia in people over 65, although it also occurs in people much younger. Alzheimer’s affects approximately 35 percent of those over 85.
Presently, researchers cannot definitely say what causes the disease, and there is no cure.
Symptoms differ from person to person, but declines in memory, thinking, and ability to function progress over a period of years, ending in a severe loss of function.
Ischemic vascular dementia (IVD)
IVD is the second most common dementia.
It’s characterized by either an abrupt loss of function or a general slowing of cognitive abilities that interferes with “executive functions,” such as planning and completing tasks.
When symptoms appear suddenly, the person has usually had a stroke.
For others, the condition develops slowly with a gradual loss of function and/or thinking.
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)
Dementia with Lewy bodies is a progressive degenerative disease.
It shares symptoms with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.
People affected by this disease have behavioral and memory symptoms that can fluctuate, as well as motor problems commonly seen with Parkinson’s disease.
Common symptoms include sleep disturbances during REM sleep and hallucinations.
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
FTD is a degenerative condition of the front (anterior) part of the brain, which can sometimes be seen on brain scans.
The frontal and anterior temporal lobes of the brain control reasoning, personality, movement, speech, language, social graces, and some aspects of memory. Symptoms may lead to misdiagnosis as a psychological or emotionally based problem.
FTD frequently occurs after age 40 and usually before age 65.
Symptoms appear in two seemingly opposite ways: Some individuals are overactive, restless, distracted, and disinhibited (showing poor social judgment); others become apathetic, inert, and have limited range of emotions.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD or Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease) is a rapidly progressive, fatal brain disease.
It is part of a family of diseases, called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, that are caused by an agent known as a prion (“pree-on”).
This condition can be very difficult to diagnose as it has many different symptoms, including behavioral changes, movement changes, cognitive changes, and general changes in well-being such as sleep problems, loss of appetite, and headaches.
Parkinson’s dementia
“Parkinsonism” is the name given to a collection of symptoms consisting of tremor, stiffness, slowness of movement, and unsteady gait.
Many neurological disorders have features of parkinsonism, including several of the dementias.
When parkinsonism occurs without any other neurological abnormalities, and there is no recognizable cause, the disorder is called Parkinson’s disease after the English physician who first described it in 1817.
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)
People with PSP usually show a group of three symptoms: Gradual loss of balance and trouble walking; loss of control of voluntary eye movements; and dementia.
Although experts consider these three symptoms to be the hallmarks of PSP, patients with this disorder also experience other symptoms common to degenerative diseases of the brain. These include difficulties with movement, speech and swallowing, as well as changes in behavior.
In part because it is relatively rare, PSP is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson’s disease. But its treatment response and clinical symptoms are different, so an accurate diagnosis is vital.
Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)
Gait instability, urinary incontinence, and dementia are the signs and symptoms typically found in patients with NPH.
Considered a rare cause of dementia, it affects persons older than 60 years.
The precise incidence of NPH is hard to determine, because the condition does not have a formal, agreed-upon definition.
Some physicians base the diagnosis on radiographic evidence (CT or MRI, for example); other health care professionals rely more on clinical indications. Still others use a combination of signs and symptoms that they have found to be reliable.
Traditionally, treatment is surgical implantation of a shunt to reduce the pressure caused by the buildup of cerebrospinal fluid.
Huntington’s disease (HD)
Huntington’s disease is a fatal disorder characterized by involuntary movements (chorea) and cognitive decline (dementia).
It’s caused by a genetic mutation that can be passed down in families.
HD is an illness with profound neurological and psychiatric features affecting structures deep within the brain — particularly the basal ganglia, responsible for movement and coordination. Structures responsible for thought, perception, and memory are also affected. This is likely due to connections from the basal ganglia to the frontal lobe of the brain.
As a result, patients may experience uncontrolled movements (such as twisting and turning), loss of intellectual abilities, and emotional and behavior disturbances.
Mixed dementias
At times, two of these conditions can overlap. This is commonly seen in Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia, as well as in Alzheimer’s disease and Lewy bodies dementia.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/is-this-dementia-what-does-it-mean/,Dementia: Is This Dementia and What Does It Mean?,"There are no cures for degenerative or irreversible dementias. For that reason, medical treatments focus on maximizing the individual’s cognitive and functional abilities.
Specific treatments vary depending on the cause of the dementia:
For patients with Alzheimer’s disease and Lewy body disease, medications called cholinesterase inhibitors are available. They can temporarily improve symptoms by boosting chemicals involved in memory and judgment. Another medication is memantine, which may temporarily improve symptoms by decreasing abnormal activity in the brain. New medications are being developed and studied, and may be approved by the FDA. They may be restricted to people in early stages of dementia or only available for those participating in clinical trials. A neurologist can help determine if these are appropriate and to evaluate the risks and benefits.
Treatment for vascular dementia focuses on controlling risk factors such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
Before a doctor would consider prescribing other medications to manage symptoms (e.g., sleep disorders, movement problems, depression, or agitation), they would need to have careful conversations about risk and benefit with the patient, their caregiver, and family. Moreover, behavioral interventions and non-pharmacological interventions would need to be tried first.
Treatments vary based on the cause. Depending on the dementia type certain medications are contraindicated – and can actually make symptoms worse. For these reasons, an accurate diagnosis is critical.
Research into the causes and treatments for dementias continues at a rapid pace. We all look forward to new developments that someday may postpone, cure, or even prevent these debilitating disorders.",dementia

Many families provide care at home for a person with dementia. While this can be an enriching and rewarding experience, it can also be stressful.

People who develop DLB can have cognitive (thinking and memory) and behavioral symptoms similar to those of Alzheimer’s disease and, to varying extents, to the motor and non-motor symptoms seen in Parkinson’s disease. However, there are some distinct contrasts to these conditions. The cognitive symptoms of a person with DLB might fluctuate from hour to hour or day to day, and attention and alertness may wax and wane. The motor symptoms may be similar to those features seen in Parkinsonʼs but their severity and treatment response may differ. Two of the most distinguishing symptoms of DLB from Alzheimer’s disease include vivid visual hallucinations, particularly early in the course of the disorder, and a sleep disorder in which the person physically acts out his/her dreams, called REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD).",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-lewy-bodies/,Dementia with Lewy Bodies,"Treating and caring for a person with DLB requires frequent assessment and reassessment. Some people with DLB can live at home with careful monitoring and supervision. Those with DLB who often experience repeat falls or fainting may benefit from a home safety assessment by an occupational or physical therapist. Ongoing attention to safety concerns from caregivers is also needed to minimize risk of falling. Particular care should be taken when a person with DLB is standing up from a chair or getting out of bed, as blood pressure can drop, causing the individual to become dizzy or lightheaded and lose his or her balance. Dementia can make it difficult for people to learn new actions that might help them overcome movement problems, such as using a cane or walker. They may need more assistance on some days than other days. Some people with DLB can be reassured by a caregiver’s help in turning attention away from the hallucinations, if present.
Caregivers must learn to navigate and adapt to cognitive, behavioral, and motor changes. Attending support groups and learning skills in how to communicate with someone with dementia, as well as learning skills in helping someone with a motor disorder, will reduce caregiver stress and frustration.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-lewy-bodies/,Dementia with Lewy Bodies,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is often called “Lewy body dementia” (LBD), which is the umbrella term that includes DLB and Parkinson’s disease dementia. DLB is biologically related to Parkinson’s disease, as both share overlapping disease processes in the brain and many clinical symptoms. 
DLB is the second most common progressive dementia, accounting for 20% of those with dementia. (Alzheimer’s disease is the most common.) Dementia is a gradual, progressive decline in mental ability (cognition) that affects memory, thinking processes, behavior, and performance of social, occupational, and daily activities.
The term DLB reflects the presence of Lewy bodies (the microscopic, smooth, round protein deposits made up of alpha-synuclein) that are found in the nerve cells of the affected parts of the brain. These “abnormal protein structures” were first described in 1912 by Frederich Heinrich Lewy, M.D., a contemporary of Alois Alzheimer, who identified clinical and pathological features of the more common form of dementia that now bears his name.
Lewy bodies are found throughout the outer layers of the brain (the cerebral cortex) and deep inside the brain in the midbrain and brainstem. They are often found in those diagnosed with Parkinsonʼs, approximately 50% of people with Alzheimerʼs, and other disorders.
The cause of DLB is unknown. Risk factors include older age and the sleep disorder RBD, which may precede other LBD symptoms by years or even decades. Some cases of DLB have appeared among families, but there does not seem to be a strong tendency for inheriting the disease. Genetic research may reveal more information in the future about causes and risks. DLB usually occurs in older adults between 50–85 years old, and slightly more men than women have the disease.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-lewy-bodies/,Dementia with Lewy Bodies,"Initial symptoms of DLB are often similar to those of Alzheimerʼs or vascular dementia and are cognitive in nature, such as progressive decline in memory, judgment, planning and organizing, or acute confusion. Some people may first show the motor symptoms of parkinsonism — slowness, stiffness in the muscles, tremors, decreased dexterity, or slow, shuffling gait. Others may have visual hallucinations as the first symptom. Those with DLB may also suffer from delusions, depression, or autonomic (i.e., blood pressure, bladder, bowels) changes.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-lewy-bodies/,Dementia with Lewy Bodies,"Problems in thinking such as inattention, lack of judgment, loss of insight, and decline in problem solving and organizational skills. People with DLB experience visuospatial difficulty (for example, finding oneʼs way around places), as well as trouble with finding the words they want to say, or following a conversation. Memory may be relatively intact in the early stage, but problems with attention and alertness may mimic memory problems.
 Fluctuation in the occurrence of cognitive symptoms from moment to moment, hour to hour, day to day, or week to week. For example, the person may converse normally one day and be more confused the next day. There are also fluctuations in attention, alertness, and wakefulness.
 Recurrent, visual hallucinations. These hallucinations are well formed, vivid, and detailed. In DLBʼs early stage, the person may even acknowledge and describe the hallucinations. They can be benign and not frightening, but in some, can be troublesome. Hallucinations may also be auditory (hearing sounds), olfactory (smelling or tasting something), or tactile (feeling or touching something that is not there).
 Movement problems of parkinsonism, sometimes referred to as “extrapyramidal” signs. These motor symptoms often seem to start spontaneously and may include bradykinesia (slowness of movement), tremor, shakiness, loss of dexterity, rigidity (limb stiffness), flexed posture, shuffling gait, muscle jerks or twitches, reduced arm swing, a tendency to fall, balance problems, and lack of facial expression. Movement and motor problems occur in later stages for 70% of persons with DLB. But for 30% of individuals, and more commonly those that are older, parkinsonian symptoms occur first, before dementia symptoms. In these individuals, cognitive decline tends to start with depression or mild forgetfulness.
 Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD). This is characterized by vivid dreaming, talking in ones sleep, and having excessive movement while asleep, including occasionally hitting or kicking a bed partner. The result may be excessive daytime drowsiness, and this symptom may appear years before DLB is diagnosed. Over 50% of people with DLB have this symptom.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-lewy-bodies/,Dementia with Lewy Bodies,"DLB can be difficult to diagnose. Not only does it resemble other dementias, it overlaps with Parkinsonʼs and psychiatric disorders. Because no single test such as a blood test or brain scan exists to diagnose DLB, a variety of medical, neurological, and neuropsychological tests are used to identify its symptoms and the possible overlap with other illnesses. A definitive diagnosis can be made only by an autopsy at death but probable and possible diagnoses can be made in life.
Although Lewy bodies are found in brains of people with other diseases, it is useful to understand what happens to the brain of a person with DLB. Three significant changes or pathological features are seen in brains of people afflicted by DLB:
The brain’s cerebral cortex (outer layers of the brain) degenerates or shrinks. This brain tissue shrinkage (or atrophy) can affect reasoning and complex thinking, understanding personality, movement, speech, and language, sensory input, and visual perceptions of space. Degeneration also occurs in the limbic cortex at the center of the brain, which plays a major role in emotions and behavior. Lewy bodies form throughout these degenerating cortical areas.
 Nerve cells die in the midbrain region. This occurs especially in the substantia nigra in the brainstem, an area that also degenerates in Parkinsonʼs disease. These cells are involved in making the neurotransmitter (brain messenger) dopamine. Lewy bodies are found in the nerve cells that remain. The midbrain is involved in motor control, sleep/wake, arousal, sensory and autonomic functions.
 Another cellular structure, Lewy neurites, that affect nerve cell function are found in the brains of people who have DLB, especially in the hippocampus, an area of the brain essential for forming new memories.
None of the symptoms found in DLB are specific only to this disorder. To address this problem, an international group of researchers and clinicians developed a set of diagnostic criteria called the Consensus Guidelines, most recently updated in 2017, that can reliably point to features of DLB:",dementia

 Visual hallucinations: Detailed and well-formed visions, which occur and recur.
 Parkinsonism: Movement problems.
 RBD: Physically acting out dreams while asleep.
A DLB diagnosis is even more likely if the individual also experiences any of the following: repeated falls, fainting, brief loss of consciousness, delusions, apathy, anxiety, problems with temperature and blood pressure regulation, urinary incontinence, and chronic constipation, loss of smell, or sensitivity to neuroleptic medications that are given to control hallucinations and other psychiatric symptoms.
Finally, the timing of symptoms is a reliable clue: if cognitive symptoms appear before or within a year of motor symptoms, DLB is more likely the cause than Parkinson’s disease. Signs of stroke or vascular dementia usually negate the likelihood of DLB.
Testing is usually done to rule out other possible causes of dementia, motor, or behavioral symptoms. Brain imaging (CT scan or MR imaging) can detect brain shrinkage and help rule out stroke, fluid on the brain (normal pressure hydrocephalus), or subdural hematoma. Blood and other tests might show vitamin B12 deficiency, thyroid problems, syphilis, HIV, or vascular disease. Depression is also a common cause of dementia-like symptoms. Additional tests can include an electroencephalogram (EEG) or spinal tap (lumbar puncture).
New research confirms several tests are highly associated with the presence of Lewy bodies in the brain and are now increasingly being used to help make a DLB diagnosis. Scans using SPECT or PET technology can detect differences between DLB and Alzheimer’s disease. A sleep study can confirm RBD, and special cardiac imaging can detect changes in cardiac nerves associated with DLB.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-lewy-bodies/,Dementia with Lewy Bodies,"DLBʼs similarity to Alzheimerʼs and Parkinsonʼs diseases, and the fact that Lewy bodies are often found in the brains of people with these diseases, means that clinicians must pay close attention to the factors that distinguish DLB. These factors include:
Memory and other cognitive problems occur in both DLB and Alzheimerʼs. However, in DLB they fluctuate frequently.
 In DLB, Alzheimer-like and Parkinson-like symptoms may appear within one year of each other.
 Hallucinations are experienced in the late stages of Alzheimerʼs, and by people with Parkinsonʼs who take medications to improve movement and tremor. In DLB, hallucinations occur in early stages, even without Parkinson’s medications, and they are frequent, vivid, and detailed.
 Neuroleptic drugs (sometimes called psychotropic drugs) prescribed to lessen the so-called psychiatric symptoms of dementia, such as hallucinations, agitation, or restlessness will induce or worsen Parkinsonʼs-like symptoms in some people with DLB.
 Tremor is typically less pronounced in DLB than in Parkinsonʼs. Also, individuals with DLB respond less dramatically to drugs such as levodopa that are used to treat Parkinsonʼs.
 Some people with Parkinsonʼs develop dementia in later stages. However, dementia is usually the presenting symptom in DLB.
 Someone with Parkinsonʼs loses the neurotransmitter dopamine; in Alzheimerʼs people lose the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. A person with DLB or Parkinson’s disease dementia loses both.
 Life expectancy is slightly shorter in DLB than Alzheimerʼs and Parkinson’s.
 At autopsy, the brains of those with DLB look essentially the same as a person with Parkinson’s disease with dementia, as Lewy bodies are spread throughout the brain. People with DLB frequently have some co-existing changes of Alzheimer’s disease in the brain as well. ",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dementia-lewy-bodies/,Dementia with Lewy Bodies,"With an average lifespan after onset of 5 to 7 years, the progression of dementia with Lewy bodies is relentless; however, the rate of decline varies with each person. DLB does not follow a set pattern of stages as is seen in some other dementias. There is neither cure nor specific treatment to arrest the course of the disease. Death usually occurs from pneumonia, complications of immobility, or other illnesses.
While there are no medications currently approved to specifically treat DLB, there are many medications developed for other conditions that can help reduce some of its symptoms. A comprehensive treatment plan can improve the quality of life for a person with DLB and their family caregiver.
However, caution must be used in treating a person with DLB. Medications must be monitored closely for proper balance because some people are negatively affected by some drugs. Neuroleptic (tranquilizing) antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol (Haldol) or thioridazine (Mellaril), some newer atypical antipsychotics (especially risperidone, olanzapine) as well as benzodiazepines (Valium, Ativan), and certain antihistamines like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) can cause extreme adverse reactions in those with DLB. Side effects include worsened motor-related symptoms, catatonia (non-responsiveness), loss of cognitive function, and/or development of muscle rigidity. These medications are sometimes used in Alzheimerʼs to help with hallucinations, agitation, and behavioral symptoms, but should not be used in individuals with DLB. Levodopa may be given to treat the parkinsonism, however, it may increase the hallucinations in someone with DLB and aggravate other symptoms, such as confusion or low blood pressure. It is generally less effective in treating motor symptoms in those with DLB than in those with Parkinsonʼs, especially since higher doses are rarely given. Dementia symptoms may be treated with medications originally developed for Alzheimer’s disease, called cholinesterase inhibitors. Research shows these medications can be even more effective in people with DLB. As such, some of these treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies for Lewy body disorders; donepezil was approved in Japan for DLB and rivastigmine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of dementia in Parkinson’s disease. Treating hallucinations can be challenging since typical and atypical antipsychotics can worsen motor function; some newer antipsychotics with greater serotonin (another brain chemical) mechanisms (such as quetiapine and clozapine) are preferred by DLB experts to treat hallucinations in this disorder. Some antidepressants have also shown positive results, while others are counter-indicated. More research is urgently needed in this area to determine which medications are both safe and effective to treat hallucinations and delusions in DLB.
When considering surgery, families should meet with the anesthesiologist to discuss possible side effects of anesthesia, as persons with DLB are prone to delirium or confusion with anesthesia. Sometimes this ‘stepping down’ of cognitive ability noticed after anesthesia can linger or remain. In addition, families of those with DLB who are having surgery or who are hospitalized should discuss current medications and any potentially anticipated medications with the healthcare professional team in advance; neuroleptics (antipsychotics) and some anti-nausea medications can worsen motor parkinsonism and should be avoided.",dementia

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dental-care-dementia/,Dental Care (for dementia),"Dental hygiene is important for overall health. Poor dental hygiene may lead to heart disease, gingivitis, stroke, osteoporosis, and respiratory disease. In addition to causing bad breath, inadequate dental hygiene can also affect one’s ability to eat, chew, and talk. Certain medications can cause “dry mouth.” Dry mouth makes it more difficult to eat and swallow, produce saliva, and causes tongue irritation.
 Brushing teeth is a complicated process with many steps. Although most of us do it automatically, if someone is having memory problems, some of the steps might be forgotten. Supervision or assistance is often necessary.
 Talking someone through the steps or modeling the steps yourself at the same time might help the affected person be more successful. Give the person the toothbrush with toothpaste already on it and put your hand over theirs to start the up-and-down brushing movement to help get started. It may be easier to stand behind the person while doing this.
 The bathroom is not the only choice for brushing teeth. A basin on a table or the kitchen sink might work better. It also doesn’t have to be the last thing at night before bed or the first thing in the morning. Find a time when both you and the person for whom you are caring are calm and have time to devote to the task.
 A toothbrush with a large handle can be easier to hold onto and maneuver. Put the handle through a tennis ball to give the person something larger to grasp. Another option is an electric toothbrush, which may prove easier to use.
 Although fluoride toothpaste is the best, if the person is likely to swallow the fluoride toothpaste, rather than spit it out, try brushing just with water or baking soda toothpaste.
 Never force someone to open their mouth, and do not pry their lips apart. Take a break and try later if there is a problem or resistance. If the toothbrush is too invasive or if the bristles are too rough on your loved one’s delicate gums, try using a Q-tip or gauze wrapped around your finger. If dental care at home is proving to be very difficult or extremely unpleasant for you both, make an appointment to see a dentist every two months for regular dental care.
 It might be easier, if you are doing the brushing, to sit the person on a chair and to brush their teeth from behind. Flossing is also easier from this position.
 Flossing may be more important than brushing. Use a floss holder, Flexi-Picks, or Stim-u-dent, or use a tiny brush that can fit between teeth to clean the gums as well as the teeth.
 Anti-plaque mouthwash can be helpful in preventing gum disease—but ONLY if it won’t be swallowed. This can be a substitute for brushing, if necessary. Some mouthwashes can also help with dry mouth, as can artificial saliva products. Talk with your dentist about alternatives if swallowing mouthwash is an issue.
 Dentures need to be taken out daily, brushed, and rinsed. While they are out, try to brush the person’s gums and the roof of their mouth with a soft bristled toothbrush. Gum shrinkage can cause dentures to fit improperly, leading to pain, trouble eating, and infection. Have them checked regularly by your dentist.
 Possible signs of dental problems include someone rubbing or touching their cheek or jaw, moaning or shouting out, head rolling or nodding, and flinching, especially when washing their face or being shaved. Restlessness, poor sleep, increased irritation or aggression, and refusal or reluctance to put in dentures when previously there was not a problem are other signs of dental issues.
 Find a dentist who understands dementia who will work with you and your loved one.
 Apples can help clean teeth while being chewed. Avoid hard candy, and be sure to drink plenty of water.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/depression-and-caregiving/,Depression and Caregiving,"Many people with symptoms of depression don’t describe themselves as feeling depressed. Some people don’t recognize the symptoms in themselves, while others may have a hard time admitting they feel depressed. It can be embarrassing to talk about. An individual may feel like a failure or that people will judge them. But here’s what you need to know: for caregivers, depression is more common than you might think, and it’s a normal response to a difficult situation. It is not unusual for caregivers to develop mild or more serious depression as a result of the constant demands they face while providing care.
Depression is an extremely complex condition with many research studies underway to pinpoint the cause(es). Known contributing factors include genetic characteristics, hormone levels, environmental triggers, certain medications, the effects of living with a major illness, grief and loss due to the the death of a loved one, having experienced physical or emotional abuse, living with someone with serious depression, and other factors. Not everyone will experience the negative feelings that go with depression. But we know that in an effort to provide the best possible care for a family member or friend, caregivers often sacrifice their own physical and emotional needs. The complex and varied aspects involved with providing care can strain even the most capable person. Feelings of overwhelm, agitation, anxiety, distress, pessimism, isolation, exhaustion—and sometimes guilt for having these feelings—can exact a heavy toll.
Everyone has negative thoughts or feelings that come and go over time, but when these feelings become more intense and leave you drained of energy, tearful or irritable towards a loved one, it may well be a warning sign of depression. Concerns about depression arise when the emptiness and crying don’t go away, or when those negative feelings are unrelenting.
Unfortunately, feelings of depression are often seen as a sign of weakness rather than a sign that something is out of balance. Comments from others such as “snap out of it” or “it’s all in your head” are not helpful, and reflect a belief that mental health concerns are not real. Ignoring or denying your feelings will not make them go away.
Early attention to symptoms of depression through exercise, a healthy diet, positive support of family and friends, or consultation with a trained health or mental health professional may help to prevent the development of a more serious depression over time.",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/depression-and-caregiving/,Depression and Caregiving,"People experience depression in different ways. Some may feel classic symptoms, like sadness and hopelessness. Others may have signs that you might not equate with depression, such as extreme fatigue or irritability. The type and degree of symptoms vary by individual and can change over time. Consider these common symptoms of depression. Have you experienced any of the following for longer than two weeks?
Feeling sad, tearful, empty, hopeless
Changes in eating habits—weight loss and no appetite or cravings with weight gain
Changes in sleep—too much sleep or not enough
Feeling tired all the time, difficulty being motivated to do anything
A loss of interest in people and/or activities that once brought you pleasure
Feeling numb
Becoming easily agitated or angered
Feeling that nothing you do is good enough
Increase in alcohol or drug consumption
Excessive time on the Internet
Trouble focusing, thinking, or planning—as if your head was filled with fog
Neglecting your physical well-being and appearance
Thoughts of running away, or escaping from the situation
Thoughts of death or suicide, ideas of how to end your life
Ongoing physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders, and chronic neck and back pain",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/depression-and-caregiving/,Depression and Caregiving,"Caring for a person with dementia can be all consuming. Researchers have found that a person who provides care for someone with dementia is twice as likely to suffer from depression as a person providing care for someone without dementia. Not only do caregivers spend significantly more hours per week providing care, they report more employment problems, personal stress, mental and physical health problems, lack of sleep, less time to do the things they enjoy, less time to spend with other family members, and more family conflict than non-dementia caregivers.
As stressful as the deterioration of a loved one’s mental and physical abilities may be for the caregiver, dealing with dementia-related behavior is an even bigger contributor to developing depression. Dementia-related symptoms such as wandering, agitation, hoarding, embarrassing conduct. and resistance or non-cooperation from the loved one makes every day challenging and makes it harder for a caregiver to get rest or assistance in providing care. The more severe the case of dementia, the more likely the caregiver is to experience depression. It is critical for caregivers, especially in these situations, to receive consistent and dependable support and respite.
Women experience depression at a higher rate than men. Women, primarily wives and daughters, provide the majority of caregiving. In the United States, approximately 12 million women experience clinical depression each year, at approximately twice the rate of men. If you think depression is all in your head, think again. Physical factors like menopause, childbirth, PMS, thyroid disease, and nutritional deficiencies in iron, vitamin D, and Omega-3 fatty acids can all cause depression.
A Mental Health America study found that many women do not seek treatment for depression because they are embarrassed or in denial about being depressed. In fact, 41% of women surveyed cited embarrassment or shame as barriers to treatment. Keep in mind that doctors have heard it all. It is important to both your mental and physical health to get a complete physical exam. Take time during the exam to bring up the subject of depression if you suspect you are experiencing symptoms of depression.
Men who are caregivers deal with depression differently. Men are less likely to admit to depression and doctors are less likely to diagnose depression in men. Men will more often “self-treat” their depressive symptoms of anger, irritability, or feelings of powerlessness with alcohol or overwork. Although male caregivers tend to be more willing than female caregivers to hire outside help for assistance with home care duties, they tend to have fewer friends to confide in or positive activities to engage in outside the home. The mistaken assumption that depressive symptoms are a sign of weakness can make it especially difficult for men to seek help.
  Military and veteran caregivers are at risk of depression. Military and veteran caregivers experience depression nearly twice the rate of non-military caregivers. The more severe the mental and/or physical health conditions of the veteran, the more demands you face as a caregiver. Conditions like dementia, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress disorder (TBI and PTSD) can be particularly challenging for caregivers. Trying to cope with daily life in addition to watching out for the veteran’s triggers, or helping them cope with their own stress, can lead you to feel overwhelmed and increase feelings of depression, particularly feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. As a military caregiver, you may not have other people in your life who understand the experience of caring for a service member, particularly younger caregivers whose peers are unlikely to be facing the same kinds of challenges. You may have even moved to have better access to VA benefits, or to a region that is more supportive to your veteran’s needs, which can make you feel even more isolated and less likely to have help from people you know and trust. That doesn’t mean help isn’t available. The first step is to talk to your doctor who can refer you to a mental health professional and can prescribe medications as appropriate.
  Lack of sleep contributes to depression. While sleep needs vary, most people need eight hours a day. Loss of sleep as a result of caring for a loved one can lead to serious depression. The important thing to remember is that even though you may not be able to get your loved one to rest throughout the night, you can arrange to get much needed sleep. Hiring a respite worker or engaging a friend to be with your loved one while you take a nap, finding a day care center, or scheduling a stay over with another family member for a few nights, are a few ways to keep your caregiving commitment while getting the sleep you need.
  Depression can persist after placement in a care facility. Making the decision to move a loved one to a care center is very stressful. While many caregivers are finally able to catch up on much needed rest, the loneliness, guilt, and monitoring the care a loved one receives in this new location can add new stress. Many caregivers feel depressed at the time of placement and some continue to feel depressed for some time after.
People assume that once caregiving is over, the stress from providing hands-on care will go away. Yet, researchers found that even three years after the death of a spouse with dementia, some former caregivers continued to experience depression and loneliness. In an effort to return their life to normal, former caregivers may need to seek help for depression as well.",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/depression-and-caregiving/,Depression and Caregiving,"Depression deserves to be treated with the same attention afforded any other illness, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Likewise, the best way to figure out what is causing symptoms is to talk to a qualified professional, like your doctor. If you feel uncomfortable using the term depression, tell your doctor that you are “feeling blue” or “feeling down,” and describe your personal experience and symptoms. The more specific you can be, the better your doctor can help you. The important thing is to make it a priority during your appointment and be as honest as possible so your doctor can help you.
It’s not uncommon for a person receiving care to suffer from undiagnosed depression. Everything can feel worse than it is from their perspective adding to any daily caregiving challenges you may be experiencing. If you suspect this is the case in your caregiving situation, look for an opportunity to share your concern with them. If they are reluctant to talk about it with you, encourage a trusted friend to talk with them or consider leaving a message for their doctor regarding your concern prior to their next appointment.   ",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/depression-and-caregiving/,Depression and Caregiving,"The first step to getting the best treatment for depression is to meet with a mental health professional such as a psychologist, social worker, or other licensed therapist. At the same time, schedule a physical exam with your doctor. Certain medications, as well as some medical conditions such as viral infection, can cause the same symptoms as depression, and should be evaluated by a physician. The exam should include lab tests and an interview that tests for mental status to determine if speech, memory, or thought patterns have been affected.
Although a physician may prescribe antidepressant medication, medication alone is not the most effective treatment for depression. Concurrent guidance of a mental health professional is strongly recommended. The therapist or counselor will listen to your concerns, screen you for symptoms of depression, and assist you in developing ways to address your stress and build new coping patterns.
One way to find a professional is to ask a friend for the name of someone they know and trust. You may also find someone by asking your minister or rabbi, your doctor, or if you are employed, you may check your employer’s health insurance provider list or Employee Assistance Program (EAP). In addition, national organizations can provide contact information for mental health professionals in your community. (See “Finding a Professional in Your Area” in this fact sheet.)
It is important to trust and feel comfortable with the professional you see. It is not uncommon to request a free introductory phone or in-person meeting to help determine if the professional is the right match for your particular needs and style. It is appropriate to clarify:
What the cost will be
How much your insurance will pay
How many scheduled sessions you should expect to have with the mental health therapist
 Any treatment should be evaluated regularly to ensure that it continues to contribute towards your improved health and growth.",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/depression-and-caregiving/,Depression and Caregiving,"Upon review of a physical and mental health evaluation, a course of treatment may be recommended. Primary treatment options are psychotherapy (also referred to as mental health therapy and talk therapy) and antidepressant medication. These treatments may be used alone or in combination with one another. The most frequent treatment for depressive symptoms that have progressed beyond the mild stage is antidepressant medication, which provides relatively quick symptom relief. Critical to treatment for depression is the concurrent use of psychotherapy along with medication. Discussing your situation with a therapist can open up new self-awareness for addressing a particular emotional concern and provide guidance to address challenges in getting and staying healthy.
When choosing a therapist, be sure to ask about their experience working with family caregivers and their understanding of caregiving-related stressors.
If drug therapy is recommended, a certain amount of trial and error is necessary to find the right type and dosage of medication for each individual, and it may take several weeks before effects are felt. Good communication between patient and doctor is important. Older adults should be especially careful to watch for medication side effects caused from too high a dosage or interactions with other medications.",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/depression-and-caregiving/,Depression and Caregiving,"Many complementary medicines and alternative therapies are promoted for coping with depression. Some have been tested in scientific clinical trials, but many have not. Here is an overview of some of the most common therapies:
Physical Exercise: Exercise has been found to reduce the effects of depression. Walking three times a week for 30 to 45 minutes has been linked to reducing or alleviating symptoms of depression. If that seems like a lot of time you don’t have, then start with 15 minutes once a week. The important message is to get started with a regular exercise activity.
It is unknown whether physical activity prevents the onset of depression or just helps modify the effects. Arranging time for exercise is sometimes difficult for caregivers. It is often seen as a “value added” activity—something to do when everything else is done. You might consider adding it to your “to do” list, asking a friend to give you a “walk date” each week as a gift, or requesting that your doctor write a prescription for walking or joining an exercise class. All the research shows that for a healthier life, it makes good sense to make time for exercise.
Mind-Body Techniques: There is a growing body of research showing that our thoughts, beliefs, and feelings can have a direct impact on our health, and our physical health can impact our mental state. Your mind and body are interrelated. Implementing mind-body techniques into your routine may help alleviate depression.
Even 5 to 10 minutes of any of these techniques may be beneficial. These are some to try:
Meditation
Prayer
Deep breathing
Acupuncture
Yoga
Massage
Listening to music
Creating art
Guided imagery
Journaling
Supplements: Herbal “over-the-counter” treatments such as St. John’s Wart (Hypericum perforatum) and other supplements such as SAMe and omega-3 fatty acids are under study and/or in popular use in the US and Europe for treating depressive symptoms. At present, for nonprescription drugs in the US, there are no established criteria for determining the amount of active ingredient a company puts in their product or what dose is right for a given person. Effectiveness of a product is difficult to determine, and the effects of a product can have negative side effects. For example, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning stating that St. John’s wort may affect the metabolic pathway used by many prescription drugs prescribed to treat a number of conditions, including heart disease, depression, and HIV infections.
If you are taking any herbal supplements or considering taking them, talk with your health care provider to ensure they will not interfere with any other treatment you are receiving.
Light Therapy: Caregivers who feel “the blues” when confined indoors or in response to winter’s gray days may suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), also referred to as “winter depression.” As seasons change, there is a shift in our biological internal clocks or circadian rhythms, partly in response to the changes in sunlight patterns. This can cause our biological clocks to be out of sync with our daily schedules. People with SAD have a difficult time adjusting to the shortage of sunlight in the winter months. SAD symptoms are most pronounced in January and February, when the days are shortest. SAD is often misdiagnosed as hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia, infectious mononucleosis, and other viral infections.
Light therapy, using specially designed bright fluorescent lights, has been shown to reverse SAD’s depressive symptoms. Experts believe that the light therapy works by altering the levels of certain brain chemicals, specifically melatonin. Antidepressant medication along with other treatments, including exercise, may be helpful as well. If you experience mild depressive symptoms seasonally, experiment with increasing the light in your surroundings, using lamps or other sources. If the symptoms are strong enough to impair your day-to-day functioning, seek out a mental health professional with expertise in treating SAD.",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/depression-and-caregiving/,Depression and Caregiving,"Private health insurance and Medicare may pay for some mental health care, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has increased insurance coverage for mental health benefits. Policies vary widely, so it’s best to call the mental health professional directly to find out if they accept your insurance for payment. Health insurance providers will usually list mental health professionals in the same insurance material that lists health plan medical doctors. Medicare recipients will find the booklet titled, “Medicare and Your Mental Health Benefits” a helpful source of information. See the Resources section of this fact sheet to find out how to obtain a copy.
The “covered services” of the insurance plan will specify mental health coverage for inpatient (hospital, treatment center) and outpatient (professional’s office) care, how many visits are paid for, and at what rate of reimbursement. Employed caregivers may also have access to an Employee Assistance Program, where licensed professionals (usually psychologists and social workers) are available for confidential sessions to discuss personal or professional problems.
Professionals who don’t accept insurance are called “out-of-network providers,” and they may be able to provide you with a receipt that you can submit to your insurance for partial reimbursement. Check with the professional to see if this is an option. If so, you’ll have to contact your insurance company to make sure they’ll cover some of the cost. They may require you to meet a deductible before they will start paying.
Caregivers without health insurance or who pay out-of-pocket for care will find that fees vary by professional and region, with psychiatrists and psychologists charging at the higher end of the fee scale, and therapists and social workers offering services at a more moderate rate. Some professionals offer a sliding scale fee, meaning they may slide their fee down to meet your need. There may also be low-fee clinics that have a set low fee or will apply a fee based on your ability to pay. In these settings, you are often meeting with a mental health intern who is being supervised by a licensed mental health provider. In any case, find out what the fee is up front to avoid any misunderstandings later on.",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/depression-and-caregiving/,Depression and Caregiving,"Depressive disorders can make one feel exhausted, helpless, and hopeless. Such negative thoughts and feelings make some people feel like giving up. It is important to realize that these negative views are part of the depression and may not accurately reflect the situation. Below are guidelines adapted from the National Institute of Mental Health offering recommendations for dealing with depression. Set realistic goals in light of the depression. You may not be able to accomplish as much as you are accustomed to when you are feeling well.
Break large tasks into small ones, set some priorities, and do what you can as you can.
Try to be with other people and to confide in someone you know and trust; it is often better than suffering alone.
Participate in activities that may make you feel better, such as exercise, going to a movie or ballgame, or attending a religious, social, or community event.
Expect your mood to improve gradually, not immediately. Feeling better takes time.
It is advisable to postpone important decisions until the depression has lifted. Before deciding to make a significant transition—change jobs, get married or divorced—discuss it with others who know you well and can offer another view of your situation.
People rarely “snap out of” a depression. People who expect you to do this are misguided in their understanding of your condition.
Remember, positive thinking and the practice of new coping patterns will replace the negative thinking that is part of the depression. The negative thinking will be reduced as your depression responds to treatment.
Say “yes” to offers of help and engagement by family and friends who you know and trust.
Direct assistance in providing care for your loved one, such as respite care relief, as well as positive feedback from others, positive self-talk, and recreational activities are linked to lower levels of depression. Look for classes and support groups available through caregiver support organizations to help you learn or practice effective problem-solving and coping strategies needed for caregiving. For your health and the health of those around you, take some time to care for yourself.",depression

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/diagnosing-dementia/,Diagnosing Dementia,"What does it mean when someone is said to have dementia? For some people, the word conjures up scary images of “crazy” behavior and loss of control. In fact, the word dementia describes a group of symptoms that includes short-term memory loss, confusion, the inability to problem-solve, the inability to complete multi-step activities such as preparing a meal or balancing a checkbook, and, sometimes, personality changes or unusual behavior.
Saying that someone has dementia does not offer information about why that person has these symptoms. Compare it to someone who has a fever: the person is ill from the fever, but the high temperature does not explain the cause or why this person is ill.
Does any loss of memory signify dementia? Isn’t memory loss a normal part of aging? We often hear that because someone is old, memory problems are “just natural” and are to be expected. But we know that serious memory loss is not a normal part of aging, and should not be ignored.
On the other hand, families might assume that a loved one’s noticeable loss of memory must be caused by Alzheimer’s disease. In many instances, Alzheimer’s is, in fact, the problem. But other conditions also can cause memory and cognitive problems severe enough to interfere with daily activities. These conditions can affect younger as well as older people. A clear diagnosis is needed.
Certain conditions can cause reversible dementias. These include medication interactions, depression, vitamin deficiencies, or thyroid abnormalities. It is important that these conditions be identified early and treated appropriately so that symptoms can be improved.
The irreversible dementias are known as degenerative dementias, and Alzheimer’s disease is the most common. A number of other degenerative dementias, however, may look like Alzheimer’s, but have distinct or different features that need special attention and different treatment. Reversible and irreversible dementias are described in more detail below.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/diagnosing-dementia/,Diagnosing Dementia,The diagnosis of dementia requires a complete medical and neuropsychological evaluation. The process is first to determine whether the person has a cognitive problem and how severe it is. The next step is to determine the cause in order to accurately recommend treatment and allow patients and caregivers to plan for the future.,dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/diagnosing-dementia/,Diagnosing Dementia,"Review of history or onset of symptoms
Medical history and medications
Neurological exam
Laboratory tests to rule out vitamin deficiencies or metabolic conditions
Brain imaging
Mental status testing (also called cognitive or neuropsychological testing)
The process of diagnosing dementia has become more accurate in recent years, and specialists are able to analyze the large amount of data collected and determine whether there is a problem, as well as the severity, and often the cause, of the dementia. Occasionally, there may be a combination of causes, or it may take time to monitor the individual to be sure of a diagnosis. Determining whether the cause is a reversible or irreversible condition guides the treatment and care for the affected person and family.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/diagnosing-dementia/,Diagnosing Dementia,"Deteriorating intellectual capacity may be caused by a variety of diseases and disorders in older persons. An illness and/or a reaction to medication may cause a change in mental status. Such events are sometimes called “pseudodementias.” Detecting the underlying cause of changes through medical evaluation may lead to a determination that the cause is reversible or treatable. Examples of conditions that can cause reversible symptoms of dementia include:
Reactions to medications. Adverse drug reactions are one of  the most common reasons older persons experience symptoms that mimic dementia. All medications, prescriptions, over-the-counter pills, and herbal remedies should be monitored by a physician to reduce the possibility of side effects.
Endocrine abnormalities. The conditions of low or high thyroid levels, parathyroid disturbances, or adrenal abnormalities can cause confusion that mimics dementia.
Metabolic disturbances. General confusion, as well as appetite, sleep, and emotional changes, can be caused by medical conditions including renal and liver failure, electrolyte imbalances (blood chemistry levels), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), hypercalcemia (high calcium), and diseases of the liver and pancreas.
Emotional distress. Depression or major life changes such as retirement, divorce, or loss of a loved one can affect one’s physical and mental health.  A physician should be informed about major stressful life events.
Vision and hearing. Undetected problems of vision or hearing may result in inappropriate responses and be misinterpreted. Hearing and eye exams should be performed.
Infections. Confusion can be a symptom of infection—such as a urinary tract infection (UTI)—and needs to be brought to the attention of the physician.
Nutritional deficiencies. Deficiencies of B vitamins (folate, niacin, riboflavin, and thiamine) can produce cognitive impairment.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/diagnosing-dementia/,Diagnosing Dementia,"If reversible dementias are ruled out and it is determined that the person has a degenerative or irreversible dementia, it is important that families and medical personnel seek the cause of the problem. This will help ensure that the person affected receives proper medical care, and families can plan their caregiving and find appropriate support and resources.
The following are the most common degenerative dementias:
Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia in people over 65, although the disease also occurs in people much younger. Alzheimer’s affects approximately 50 percent of those over 85. Presently, researchers cannot definitely say what causes the disease, and there is no cure. Symptoms differ from person to person, but declines in memory, thinking, and ability to function gradually progress over of a period of years, ending in a severe loss of function.
Ischemic vascular dementia (IVD). IVD is the second most common dementia, characterized by an abrupt loss of function or general slowing of cognitive abilities that interferes with what are called “executive functions” such as planning and completing tasks. When symptoms appear suddenly, the person has usually experienced a stroke. For others, the condition develops slowly with a gradual loss of function and/or thinking.
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Dementia with Lewy bodies is a progressive degenerative disease that shares symptoms with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. People affected by this disease have behavioral and memory symptoms that can fluctuate, as well as motor problems that are commonly seen with Parkinson’s disease.
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD). FTD is a degenerative condition of the front (anterior) part of the brain, which can sometimes be seen on brain scans. The frontal and anterior temporal lobes of the brain control reasoning, personality, movement, speech, language, social graces, and some aspects of memory. Symptoms may lead to misdiagnosis as a psychological or emotionally-based problem. FTD frequently occurs after age 40 and usually before age 65. Symptoms appear in two seemingly opposite ways: some individuals are overactive, restless, distracted, and disinhibited (showing poor social judgment), while others are apathetic, inert, and emotionally blunted.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD or Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease) is a rapidly progressive, fatal brain disease. It is part of a family of diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, caused by an agent known as a prion (“pree-on”). This condition can be very difficult to diagnose as it has many different symptoms, including behavioral changes, movement changes, cognitive changes, and general changes in well-being such as sleep problems, loss of appetite, and headaches.
Parkinson’s dementia. Parkinsonism is the name given to a collection of symptoms and signs consisting of tremor, stiffness, slowness of movement, and unsteady gait. Many neurological disorders have features of parkinsonism, including many of the dementias. When parkinsonism occurs without any other neurological abnormalities, and there is no recognizable cause, the disorder is termed Parkinson’s disease after the English physician who first described it fully in 1817.
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). People with PSP usually show a group of three symptoms, including the gradual loss of balance and trouble walking, loss of control of voluntary eye movements, and dementia. Although these features are considered to be the hallmarks of PSP, patients with this disorder also experience other symptoms common to degenerative diseases of the brain, including difficulties with movement, changes in behavior, and difficulty with speech and swallowing. In part because it is relatively rare, PSP is frequently misdiagnosed as Parkinson’s disease. However, its treatment response and clinical symptoms are different, making an accurate diagnosis very important.
Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Gait instability, urinary incontinence, and dementia are the signs and symptoms typically found in patients who have NPH. Considered a rare cause of dementia, it primarily affects persons older than 60 years. The precise incidence of NPH is hard to determine because the condition does not have a formal, agreed-upon definition. Some physicians base the diagnosis strongly on radiographic evidence; another group of health care professionals relies more on clinical indications. Still others use a combination of signs and symptoms that they have found to be reliable. Traditionally, treatment is surgical implantation of a shunt to reduce the pressure caused by the build up of cerebrospinal fluid.
Huntington’s disease (HD). Huntington’s disease is a fatal disease typically characterized by involuntary movements (chorea) and cognitive decline (dementia). It is caused by a genetic mutation that can be passed down from generation to generation. HD is an illness with profound neurological and psychiatric features affecting certain structures deep within the brain, particularly the basal ganglia, responsible for such important functions as movement and coordination. Structures responsible for thought, perception, and memory are also affected, likely due to connections from the basal ganglia to the frontal lobe of the brain. As a result, patients may experience uncontrolled movements (such as twisting and turning), loss of intellectual abilities, and emotional and behavior disturbances.
Mixed dementias. At times, two of these conditions can overlap. This is commonly seen in Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia, and also in Alzheimer’s disease and Lewy body dementia.
There are no cures for degenerative or irreversible dementias, so medical treatments focus on maximizing the individual’s cognitive and functional abilities. Specific treatments for dementia vary depending on the cause of the dementia.
Good communication with the primary care provider affects the well-being of the person with dementia as well as the well-being of the  caregiver. Communicating your concerns clearly and describing the changes you may have observed will help guide the provider to investigate further. In some cases, you may find yourself “educating” medical staff about your loved one’s symptoms.
An accurate diagnosis begins a process of education for caregivers and families so that needs can be met and resources located and put to use. Irreversible dementia requires a level of care that increases as the disease progresses. Through education and the use of available resources, families can learn new skills to handle shifting care needs.
Research into the cause and treatments for dementia continues at a rapid pace. We all look forward to new developments that someday may postpone, cure or even prevent these debilitating disorders.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/digital-technology-family-caregiver/,Digital Technology for the Family Caregiver,"Thanks to advances in medicine and public health, people are living longer than ever before. This means more and more family caregivers are responsible for managing the diverse needs of a loved one with chronic illness or frailty. How can family caregivers attempt to balance this added responsibility along with their own personal needs, work, parenting and other demands in their lives?
Digital technology offers practical solutions for caregivers seeking to solve a problem, learn new skills and get support. Where else but online can you find a peer group of caregivers to talk to when you need it at 1:00 in the morning? How convenient it is to post an electronic schedule that allows friends and family to sign up for tasks like bringing by a meal, driving your loved one to a doctor’s appointment or giving you respite from caregiving.
This fact sheet offers an introduction to some of the tools currently available to help manage your caregiving responsibilities and other tasks. The world of technology changes quickly, so even more new devices, applications and websites will be available in the future to help you manage care.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/digital-technology-family-caregiver/,Digital Technology for the Family Caregiver,"Computer and mobile technologies seem to be everywhere these days. Although one in five adults does not use the Internet, the majority of Americans do go online for business, for information, to stay in touch with friends, for entertainment. (Digital Differences, Pew Research) As baby boomers age, the use of technologies to manage their own care and the care of others will increase. This age group, unlike their parents, is more familiar with technology. They use it in their work and they use it at home to stay connected and manage household functions. Generally, it’s viewed more positively as a regular part of daily life. Increasingly, baby boomers will demand technology solutions to make their lives easier. And this extends to help with caregiving responsibilties as well. (Family Caregivers Need Access & Training on Assistive Technologies, December 6, 2011, Kathleen Kelly, Executive Director, Family Caregiver Alliance.)

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/digital-technology-family-caregiver/,Digital Technology for the Family Caregiver,"Practically speaking, computer apps don’t come close to solving every caregiver challenge. Where is the app that makes all of your siblings willing and able to provide care for your frail dad? Or how about the app that cleans up the bathroom after you assist your spouse, who has dementia, take his shower? No, the burden for these and many other activities remains with the caregiver.
Nonetheless, computer and mobile device applications do excel in areas such as: sorting, organizing, recording, locating, informing, matching, coaching, calming and reminding. These digital tools are evolving to provide solid service in ever dependable and useful ways.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/digital-technology-family-caregiver/,Digital Technology for the Family Caregiver,"Today more than 7,800 health-related applications alone are available across the three main mobile platforms (Android, Apple, Blackberry), according to a study by MobileHealth News. More than 500,000 apps are available across all venues and platforms with growth continuing at a rapid pace. With the overwhelming number of application to choose from, how do you find one that’s right for you and your situation?
No special credentials or qualifications are required to create a website or mobile application. Anyone with the talent, resources and/or determination can “go live” with their creation. It’s important to remember that there is no guarantee that the app has undergone expert review to ensure the information is accurate.
Here are a few tips to help you screen websites and mobile applications for your use:
For health and nutrition information, ask your doctor or health provider for suggestions. Go to trusted sources such as the U.S. National Library of Medicine or the Mayo Clinic. When reviewing a source for trusted information, check to see if a skilled professional, one who does not receive payment to promote the product or service, reviews the information.
Check for user ratings and reviews. Look for advice from real caregivers like you. It is not uncommon for companies to hire people to write positive “reviews” for their app or service.
Ask a trusted friend for their recommendations.
Visit the ‘About Us’ page on a website and check out the Board of Directors and/or staff to see if they have the expertise and knowledge on the information you’re seeking.
Before downloading an application, carefully think about what you want it to do and how it can complement what you are already doing off-line. It may be a great app for your neighbor but not right for your situation. Does the app solve a caregiving problem or meet a personal need to take care of you? If not, don’t bother.
Test the app before committing to paying a fee. You can do this by downloading a free or trial version first.
Seek out tools that work for you. Good signs are: simple installation, ease of use, regular updates for information accuracy and tool improvement. Try to avoid those that barrage you with advertising or demand too much access to private information in exchange for using the tool.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/digital-technology-family-caregiver/,Digital Technology for the Family Caregiver,"As mentioned in the chart above, not all apps work on all devices; they are dependant on the device and service plan. Once you buy a device―whether mobile, tablet, laptop or dektop―you are limited to the mobile operating system (OS) or “platform” that runs on that device. The major systems currently available are Apple, Android, Microsoft and Blackberry. When reviewing the types of applications and websites below, remember to search on the manufacturer’s website for compatability with your device and platform (or on the platform-specific store, such as iTunes for Apple devices, and Google Play for Android devices).
Coordinating Care: Need a place where family, friends and neighbors can go to find out how they can help you with caregiving? Post information for people to stay updated about life and care issues? Offer a calendar where members of your group sign up to provide transportation to doctor appointments or come by for a visit and more? Examples: https://lotsahelpinghands.com/, Tyze.com.
Managing Appointments and Tasks: These applications allow multiple people to: maintain a single calendar color-coded by user, assign and coordinate tasks, establish a list of what needs to be done and notes for the status of a given project or event. Examples: Google Calendar.
Medication Management: When faced with multiple prescriptions and over-the-counter medications, remembering when to take what pill when and with what can be confusing at best. These applications often include pill identification tools such as the FDA Drug Database, medication scheduling trackers and reminder alarms―all personalized to fit your requirements. There are even apps for the person who needs an incentive to adhere to their medication regime, employing the use of prizes, fun games, and educational tips. Examples: PillBox (National Library of Medicine), MedMinder.
Personal Health Record Tracking: Keeping track of your health, the health of the person your care for and possibly the health of children and spouse in your family are important. These apps offer secure tools to protect privacy, offer strategies to organize personal health records, and often include a way to record symptoms and keep track of test results and diagnoses. They can track hospital visits, immunization dates, maintain insurance records, and provide health-related alerts. There is even a tool to suggest questions for a doctor’s visit and then record the visit (with the okay of your doctor of course), to help remind you what was said and to share all or part of this with other key family members who were unable to attend the appointment. Examples: Mayo Health Manager, WebMD Health Manager, genieMD.
Social and Emotional Support: Caregivers all too often feel alone and isolated. Forty percent to 70 percent of family caregivers have high-risk symptoms for depression. Of these caregivers, one quarter to one-half meet the diagnostic criteria for major depression (Zarit). Communities of caregivers are available online and by mobile phone 24 hours a day to listen and to provide much needed encouragement. Examples: Strength for Caring – CareConnector, PTSD Coach, Alzheimer’s Association (https://www.alz.org).
Meditation and Spirituality: Sometimes a physical respite from caregiving isn’t always possible. You may find yourself with a mere 10-15 minutes to yourself on a particularly stressful day of caregiving―not long enough for a hot bath, perhaps, but enough time to calm your mind with an audio-based app playing nature sounds, soothing music or a repetition of mantras or chants. Whatever works to calm your mind, can certainly work on calming your body. One popular place to listen to music and sounds online is Pandora (both a website, www.pandora.com, and an app), an online radio site that allows users to type in an artist, genre or composer to build their own personalized radio station. Examples: At www.Pandora.com, try “Nature Sounds Radio.” Also, Meditation Oasis has iPhone/iPad apps like “Simply Being – Guided Meditation for Relaxation and Presence.”
Information & Education: Caregiver information classes are now being offered by webinar. Webinars are seminars where you can listen to a live presenter by phone or through the speakers on your computer while watching their visual presentation on a computer screen. Typically, these sessions offer time during or after the presentation for you to ask questions and make comments just as you might during an in-person class. Examples: Look for announcements about upcoming webinars on trusted websites such as the Family Caregiver Alliance website (www.Caregiver.org), the Alzheimer’s Association website (www.alz.org), and AgingCare.com.
Safety: What if you could set up two mobile devices that communicated with each other? One might be on your smart phone and the other installed safely on your loved one―in their shoe or on the back of their belt to help locate them should they become lost due to severe memory loss. This is now possible with GPS devices that can be programmed and personalized for your situation. For long-distance caregiving, programmable webcams and video conferencing might offer you and your loved one reassurance and peace of mind, just being able to see each other, or provide early warning if something doesn’t look right. Examples: Family Locator – Find my Family and Friends (iOS) (also available for Android), Life360, Skype, Google Chat.
Exercise and Nutrition: Mobile applications are making it easier for you to have a few more minutes to take care of you. Staying in touch by mobile phone allows you to go for a walk while you neighbor sits with your husband who has dementia. With an application that provides a selection of simple healthy meals, suggestions each morning help you decide what to make for dinner. You can also order your groceries online if you can’t make it to the grocery store for a few days. Examples: My Fitness Pal, Pedometer apps, AllRecipe.com, SpecialFork (app).
Shopping for Goods and Services: If caregiving responsibilities keep you close to home much of the time, secure websites allow you to do your errands and shop for needed items online any time, day or night. Now more and more people are taking care of banking, bill-paying, clothes and appliance shopping, refilling prescriptions, movie and book purchases, and much more online. Examples: all major banks and credit unions; Amazon.com; Overstock.com, Zappos.com
Entertainment & Brain Games: Caregivers who experience chronic stress may be at greater risk for cognitive decline including loss in short-term memory, attention and verbal IQ. (Vitaliano) Finding time for entertainment―playing e-Scrabble with your niece across country or trying some of the free games available online can both engage your brain and add some enjoyment to your life. Examples: Words With Friends2, AARP Free Brain Games, ScrabbleGames",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/digital-technology-family-caregiver/,Digital Technology for the Family Caregiver,"Do a search online to read about the kinds of tools you are interested in (customer reviews can be invaluable), before going to an app store.
Ask friends what websites or apps they find particularly useful.
Visit a store where they sell electronic devices such as mobile phones. Ask a customer salesperson to guide you in testing the tool. Find out what type of follow-up help and free training they offer. For online tools and applications, search the internet or visit the e-marketplace found on your phone to try the tool and read ratings from other users.
Seek out a family member, friend or service to provide technical assistance should you need it to get up and running or if you can’t make your device do what you want it to do.
While there is a learning curve for some of these applications and programs, many people just like you find that their lives are improved and their isolation is reduced when they use technology.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/downsizing-home-checklist-caregivers/,Downsizing a Home: A Checklist for Caregivers,"Moving is a high-stress life event, the experts tell us, and they’re right. Whether it’s cross-town or cross-country, whether to a small apartment or a large suburban home, tackling the organizing, packing, discarding, cleaning, paperwork and the myriad other tasks is a major challenge.
When you’re older and moving from the family home to a new smaller residence, possibly in a new community or your adult child’s home, sorting through decades of family history and possessions can feel overwhelming—even paralyzing.
As we progress through life, moving may signal new opportunities, a new relationship, a new adventure ahead. For an older adult this “new” opportunity may feel like a mixed blessing. On the positive side, a move may offer a sense of “lightening” to reduce the messy clutter of a family’s history, fewer home and yard chores and can help reduce feelings of isolation of living alone. More often, this relocation can be an unwelcome admission of frailty, loneliness, possible serious illness, and a loss of independence.
This tip sheet offers a handy guide to save time, energy and sleepless nights. Most importantly, the Checklist below provides a tool to help you organize your move and help it progress as smoothly as possible. Since every situation is different, select the areas that apply to you, and add your own notes in the spaces provided below.
If you are facing a crisis, such as moving a parent into an assisted care residence after a caregiving spouse dies, or into a nursing home after a devastating stroke, the process will be condensed and planning time will be minimal. This may be the most challenging experience of all. We encourage you to get as much help and support as you can from friends, family, religious communities and social service organizations. (For more information, see also FCA’s fact sheet Home Away from Home: Relocating Your Parents.)
If you are an adult child helping your parent make this move, we hope this also offers advice on how to be both supportive and efficient as you and your loved ones manage this major life event.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/downsizing-home-checklist-caregivers/,Downsizing a Home: A Checklist for Caregivers,"If you have the luxury of time, and if your parent is willing, think about beginning to declutter before a move is on the near horizon. Six months or a year prior to moving is not too early to start this process, regardless of where your parent is planning to move, or even if your family is still deciding.
Shred, toss or give away obvious items such as old cancelled checks, outdated food or medications, clothes, or extraneous household items that just take up space.
If you’re not sure, ask an accountant or tax person what records need to be retained.
Continue this decluttering process monthly until you start the major activities of sorting and packing for the move. You’ll be surprised at how much you can eliminate before you get into the emotional quandaries of dealing with prized possessions.
Collect and keep together important papers: deeds, wills, Durable Powers of Attorney, medical records, military records, diplomas and degrees, birth certificates, passports. These can be in a file cabinet or safe-deposit box, but let key family members know where they are.
Try not to allow grown children to use the home as a storage unit or museum. Now is the time for them to claim their keepsakes—old sports trophies, CDs, posters, school projects–and remove them from their parent’s house.
Throughout the process, try to limit sorting and packing activities to no more than two hours per day for your parent. Try to keep it relaxed and companionable. Have a cup of tea (or glass of wine!), and take breaks.

Include to-do lists, a calendar/timeline, things you’re likely to forget, questions about the new residence, floor plans. Even anecdotes or historical notes about possessions, or offhand remarks like “Oh, Aunt Judy would love this tea set.” Although the notebook may not be particularly orderly, at least you’ll know where to find the information.
Find and get estimates from moving companies. Some fees may be negotiable if you plan ahead and schedule the move for nonpeak times.
Set a firm date for the move.
Make a floor plan or template of the new home, whether it’s one room or something larger. Be sure measurements are accurate, and reflect placement of doors, windows, appliances, built-in shelves, linen storage, heater vents, etc. You now know precisely how much space you will have; you don’t need to guess.
Make a preliminary plan of where major furniture will go in the new place—bed, couch, table and chairs, TV, bookshelf, dresser and desk, for example. Again, measure carefully. If pieces can serve more than one purpose, all the better.
If finances allow, think about hiring a move manager, senior relocation specialist or organizer. Fees vary across the country. A real estate agent may be a good referral source to find this specialist, or get recommendations from friends, seniors’ residences or senior centers. This person can help with all or part of:
sorting and decision-making
packing
arranging the move
arranging for charity pick up, garage sale, estate sale or consignment shops
unpacking boxes and arranging new home.
If pets are involved, be sure to have a plan for them to be moved and accommodated in the new home.
If needed, change providers for utilities such as gas and electricity.
Refill prescriptions in advance.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/downsizing-home-checklist-caregivers/,Downsizing a Home: A Checklist for Caregivers,"Plan on going through one room at a time. Start with the easiest. Don’t try to pack now, just sort.
Divide furniture and possessions into four categories:
definitely save (these are the most useful, most beloved, most meaningful items)
possibly save (you’ll need to revisit these later, and continue paring down)
donate, sell or giving away to a friend.
discard.
Use colored tags or stickers to indicate in which category items belong, e.g., green=save, orange=possibly save, blue=donate/sell; red=discard.
This is the time to designate items to be given to specific people. Make a list.
Items that have much sentimental value but are not likely to be taken can be memorialized in photographs. Later, you can put these on a DVD or into an album.
Don’t try to sort paperwork or photos at this point, unless it’s immediately obvious certain items are not needed or wanted. This kind of decision-making takes too long and is too draining. Pack it up and it can be sorted in the new home. Shred discarded paperwork.
The number of kitchen items should be greatly reduced if your parent is going to a residence or facility that serves meals.
If possible, and if the move is not far from the family home, move your parent out first, taking only the designated furniture and items he/she wants and needs. Leave the rest of the household goods and clean-up to be dealt with after the move. (Also, items will be available for retrieval if it turns out they’re missed.)
Be patient and allow time at this stage for your parent to talk about memories, to reminisce about family activities or relatives no longer with you, to acknowledge emotions. This can be a nice opportunity for you both to remember the stories and incidents that are part of your history and that make each family unique.
Don’t go overboard purging items to take—you can keep some collectibles, especially if they’re small. You want the new residence to look like a home, not a motel room!

Label all boxes with their destination room/area in the new residence.
Moving companies can supply specialized containers, e.g., wardrobe boxes, so you can leave clothes on hangers.
Pack “open first” box(es). The contents are for setting up sleeping accommodations and the bathroom. Include items such as fresh bedding, soap, toilet paper, toothpaste & toothbrush, comb, nightclothes, towel, plate and utensils, one change of clothes, flashlight, tape, scissors.
Pack other important items that you’ll keep with you during the move: new lease or residence contract, keys, medications, legal documents, checkbook, cell phone, address book, first-aid kit, extra cash, your relocation notebook.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/dressing-and-grooming-dementia/,Dressing and Grooming (for dementia),"Simplify clothing choices by putting out an outfit for the care receiver to wear, or give an option of two outfits. Do not ask open-ended questions like, “What do you want to wear?”—this kind of question can overwhelm someone with dementia.
 Buy clothes that are simple to put on/take off and are soft and stretchable, i.e. pants with elastic waistbands, shoes that close with Velcro or slip on shoes, or a camisole instead of a bra. A skirt or loose fitting dress can be easier for a woman to put on and pull up when using the bathroom. Clothing that fastens in the front is easier to put on than clothing that goes over the head.
 Put clothes out on the bed in the order in which they should be put on. Thus, underwear would be on top, and pants/shirts would be on the bottom. If necessary, cue the person by telling him/her what piece of clothing to put on next.
 Empty the closet of clothes that are no longer appropriate or too frustrating to put on and take off. This will make it easier to choose an outfit without being distracted by too many choices.
 A person with dementia will often wear the same outfit for many days. Buying duplicate outfits can help the care receiver change clothes without a fight. When taking clothes off at night, put the dirty clothes in the laundry, so they are not seen in the morning when the person is dressing.
 People with dementia do not self-regulate their body temperature often, so you might need to monitor if their clothing is appropriate for the weather.
 Allow the person to do as much as possible by himself/herself, but intervene if he/she is getting frustrated. Have a routine for dressing, including doing so at the same time each day, as well as putting clothes on in the same order each day.
 Combing hair, shaving, cleaning fingernails, using hand cream, and washing the face may all become problematic. Have a routine for doing these things. They don’t necessarily have to be done every day.
 An electric razor will make shaving easier. Shaving does not necessarily need to be done in the bathroom. Choosing a time during the day when the care receiver is sitting in a comfortable chair can make this task easier.
 Some people prefer a comb, others may prefer a hairbrush. Use whichever is easiest for the care receiver as well as for you. Sometimes a person will be able to do this independently by watching what you are doing on yourself or by having your hand on top of his/hers while making the brushing movement.
 Regular visits to the hairdresser or barber will reduce the need to wash hair at home. Manicures and pedicures can be calming and can often be done at the same time.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/evaluating-medical-research/,Evaluating Medical Research,"Hardly a day goes by without a story on television, in the newspaper, or on the Internet about new medical research findings. You might hear about a new drug to treat Alzheimer’s, a promising “cure” for cancer, or a breakthrough discovery in Parkinson’s disease. Or you might see articles about particular foods or dietary supplements that are said to promote health or prevent or slow the course of an illness. Should you try to get these drugs for a family member who is sick? Should the person change his diet? Take more vitamins?
It’s confusing when research findings are contradictory. Conflicting health news stories—for example, drinking a glass or two of wine is good or bad for you, taking vitamin A may prevent one form of cancer but cause another to worsen—leave everybody, caregivers and health professionals alike, wondering what to do next.
It is possible to find your way through the massive amounts of information and misinformation and make informed decisions about your health, and the health of your loved ones. Reaching that point takes effort, awareness, and trust in your own powers of perception.
Before deciding whether to investigate news reports further, consider the following:
Is the headline or story presentation sensationalized—a tactic used mainly to grab attention?Is there “context” for the story—for example, background information that can help you evaluate the importance of a new finding?
Is there “fair balance” in the reporting—that is, presentation of varying points of view?If the story is on television or radio, does it somehow tie in to one of the show’s advertisers? If on the web or in print, is the story positioned near a related advertisement? On close inspection, is the story identified as an advertisement? Does the story’s originator also sell the product?
If, after considering these factors, the new finding or treatment seems possibly helpful to a loved one, then it’s time to get more details. The following guidelines can help you evaluate the research, separate fact from hype, and identify stories that may be misleading, inaccurate or incomplete.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/evaluating-medical-research/,Evaluating Medical Research,"First, try to find the original research article by contacting the website, newspaper, radio or television station responsible for the news story. This may be easier to do online or at a library or by calling the institution that sponsored the research; a journalist may or may not get back to you. Once you locate the article, read it thoroughly. Keep in mind that understanding articles written by physicians or scientists for their peers (other members of the scientific community) can be a challenge. The writing style is often technical. Many of the words will be unfamiliar, and you should be prepared to look them up in a medical dictionary or glossary.
Here are some questions to help you assess whether an article might be of interest.
How was the study conducted? In the laboratory, with animals, or with people? Laboratory research, or research with animals, is usually years away from use in a clinic. The results of research with people are more likely to be meaningful to you and your loved one.
Where was the article published? If it appeared in a peer-reviewed medical journal, it has more credibility than if it is posted only on the investigator’s website or in a company’s brochure. If the study is reported at a medical meeting, but has not been published in a journal, then the treatment probably needs to undergo further study.
Who conducted the study? A group of researchers based at a reputable university or research institution, or an individual without clear affiliations? Be particularly cautious about accepting claims about treatment effectiveness in articles by people who intend to sell the treatment.
Who funded the study? If a researcher received funding from an independent granting agency that uses a peer-review process for evaluating and awarding funds, the findings may be more credible and less subject to bias than if the funding agency has a vested interest in the results. If a study is sponsored by a commercial entity, this should be disclosed. But although sponsorship may influence the authors’ conclusions in some instances, this is not always the case. There are many research partnerships among industry, university-based researchers, and institutes, so this can be a difficult issue to assess.
How many people were tested? How many completed the study? A small number of participants does not mean the study is invalid, but the small number could lead to questionable results. In most cases, particularly when investigating causes and treatments of chronic illnesses, researchers need to study a large population over a long period of time to ensure that any observed differences are not simply the result of chance.
What were the characteristics of the people who participated in the study? Sometimes, treatments are effective only for certain groups of people—for example, a particular age group, or those whose disease is at a particular stage. Did the researchers study people like your family member? Studies of groups of people who differ from your age, gender, health status, and ethno-cultural background may or may not apply to you.
Have the results of the study been repeated by other investigators? If this is the only study of its kind, then further research is needed to validate and/or repeat the results.
If a drug was tested, were there any side effects? If so, do they outweigh the potential benefits of using the drug? Has the drug been approved by the Food and Drug Administration? If not, are clinical trials of the drug underway? When does the manufacturer estimate that the drug will be available? It often takes many years of testing before drugs are deemed safe enough for use by the public.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/feeding-and-nutrition-dementia/,Feeding and Nutrition (for dementia),"Avoid food fights. Make mealtime as pleasant as possible. Encourage someone to eat, but don’t demand, cajole, or threaten.
 Someone with dementia may not know what he/she wants to eat. If giving choices, give only two things to choose between. Even if a choice is made, the person may not want it when it is presented. Don’t take it personally. If you know his/her favorite foods, have them available for back up. Favorite foods might change.
 People often crave sweet things, so make them available, in limited quantities, unless medically not recommended, e.g. diabetes. Fruit can often fulfill this need. We all lose taste buds as we age, so food doesn’t taste the same. For some people, bland food is fine, and for others, we need to spice it up.
 People will often not eat a large meal or the traditional three meals a day. Try offering smaller, more frequent meals. Or offer nutritional supplements between meals. Always have water or other liquids available and offer them often, so the person doesn’t get dehydrated.
 Use small plates, as large ones can be overwhelming. Use color contrast of plate and food for the person to more easily distinguish the food. Turn the plate if the person has eaten all the food on one side. Chop food into small pieces to make it easier to chew. For some people, serving one food at a time might be less overwhelming.
 If coordination and independence are an issue, offer finger foods—sandwiches, cut up fruits and vegetables, cheese cubes, fish sticks, chicken nuggets, etc.
 If a person is having trouble swallowing, use a straw when offering liquids. Or use a thickening agent and pureed foods rather than thin liquids. Get a referral to a speech therapist to assess the problem, and learn ways to cue someone to swallow. Learn the Heimlich maneuver.
 If someone is reluctant to eat, he/she may be having a chewing problem ranging from dentures that don’t fit correctly to oral pain or other dental problems. Try softer foods, such as applesauce, cottage cheese, yogurt, eggs, and puddings.
 Sit with the person, if possible, while eating, to create an atmosphere of friendliness. People often eat very slowly, and so sitting with the care receiver during the entire meal time might be burdensome. However if you sit at the beginning of the meal, it will be a way to model eating for the person. Decrease distractions such as TV and radio. Limit utensils to the one that is needed at a given time in the meal. Serve soup in a cup so it can be drunk rather than spooned out.
 If your loved one needs to be fed, offer one food item at a time. Make sure he/she has swallowed before offering the next bite. Demonstrate and cue eating behavior.
 Serve food at the right temperature to eat right now. Waiting for food to cool might be a deterrent to eating or a burn hazard.
 People with memory problems may not remember to eat or may ask again for a meal, having forgotten they already ate. Keep healthy snacks available, rather than telling them that they just ate.",dementia

An Advance Health Care Directive is a document in which you can: 1) instruct your physician as to the kinds of medical treatment you might want or not want in the future (in many states, this is called a Living Will); and 2) choose someone to make medical decisions for you in the event you are unable to make those decisions yourself (in many states, this is called a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care, or just a Power of Attorney for Health Care). For additional information on advance directives, see FCA fact sheet Advance Health Care Directives and POLST, and FCA tip sheet Making End-of-Life Decisions: What Are Your Important Papers?
Agent. Person you designate to act for you or in place of you to carry out your business.
Attorney-in-Fact. The person named in a Durable Power of Attorney to act as an agent. This person need not be an attorney.
Beneficiary. An individual who receives the benefit of a transaction, for example, a beneficiary of a life insurance policy, a beneficiary of a trust, beneficiary under a Will.
Conservatee or Ward. The incapacitated person for whom a conservatorship or guardianship has been established.
Conservator or Guardian. An individual who is appointed by the court to act on behalf of an incapacitated person.
Conservatorship or Guardianship. A court proceeding in which the court supervises the management of an incapacitated person’s affairs and/or personal care.
Directive to Physicians. A written document in which an individual states his or her desire to have life-sustaining procedures withheld or withdrawn under certain circumstances. This document must meet certain requirements under the law to be valid. 
Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care. A type of Advance Health Care Directive, this is a document in which an individual nominates a person as his or her agent to make health care decisions for them if they are not able to give medical consent. This document can give the agent the power to withdraw or continue life-sustaining procedures.
Durable Power of Attorney for Asset Management. (Durable Power of Attorney for Finance). A document in which individuals (the “principal”) nominate a person as their agent (attorney-in-fact) to conduct financial transactions on their behalf. This document can be either “springing,” which means that it is effective only upon the principal’s incapacity, or “fixed,” which means that the document becomes effective when it is signed.
Executor. The individual named in a Will who is responsible for administering an estate during probate. The Executor is the person responsible for making sure all taxes and other expenses are paid and for distributing the property of the deceased person in accordance with the Will.
Federal Estate Taxes. A tax is due at death if the estate exceeds a certain amount and is calculated on the value of the deceased person’s estate at the time of death.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (aka HIPAA). Federal legislation that limits the formal and informal communication of information from doctors and other health care providers to persons other than the patient.
In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS). A program in California that pays for non-medical services for persons who meet certain financial criteria and who could not remain safely at home without such services.
Irrevocable Trust. A trust that has terms and provisions which cannot be changed.
Joint Tenancy. A form of property ownership by two or more persons designated as “joint tenants.” When a joint tenant dies, his or her interest in the property automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant and is not subject to probate.
Life Estate. An interest in property (usually a house) that lasts for the life of the person retaining the life estate. When a person who has a life estate interest dies, the property passes to the person holding the remainder interest, without the need for probate.
Living Will. A written document in which an individual conveys his or her desire to die a natural death and not be kept alive by artificial means. Unlike a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care, the wishes in this document are not legally enforceable in many states.
Long-Term Care Insurance. Private insurance that, depending on the terms of the policy, can pay for home care, or care in an assisted living facility or skilled nursing facility.
Medicaid. A state and federally financed program that provides medical care to low-income persons. In California it’s called Medi-Cal.
Medicare. A federal medical coverage program for persons who are over 65 years old or who are disabled. It is funded by Social Security deductions and has no income or resource restrictions. It does not pay for long-term custodial care.
Probate. The court proceeding that oversees the administration of a deceased person’s estate. Wills are subject to probate (which incurs costs); living trusts (if properly funded) are not.
Revocable Living Trust. A device that describes certain property, names a trustee (who manages the property), and names a beneficiary who receives benefit from the trust. A living trust is an effective means of avoiding probate and providing for management of assets. It can be revoked by the person who created it during that person’s lifetime.
Social Security Retirement Benefits. Benefits, which eligible workers and their families receive when the worker retires. The worker must work for a specified period at a job that is covered by Social Security in order to be eligible for benefits. A worker must be at least 62 years old to begin to receive retirement benefits; the amount received increases the longer someone works.
Social Security Disability Benefits. Social Security benefits payable to disabled workers and their families.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/food-for-thought-nutrition-for-people-living-with-dementia/,Food for Thought: Nutrition for People Living With Dementia,"Two years ago, Anna’s 84-year old mother was diagnosed with an Alzheimer’s-type dementia. As the disease progressed, Anna was increasingly finding spoiled food in her mother’s refrigerator. Now, though she claims she is eating just fine, Anna’s mother cannot seem to recall what she’s most recently eaten. Anna is concerned that her mother’s nutrition is suffering. Knowing that adequate fluid intake and a balanced diet are essential to helping her mother stay as healthy as possible, Anna decides to research nutritional tips for people living with dementia. Though she’s already busy trying to balance the needs of her mom with those of her family and a part-time job, Anna is intent on finding simple tips that are easy to implement so she can help ensure that her mother eats and drinks enough to provide the energy, vitamins, and nutrients she needs. Poor nourishment is a serious risk for people like Anna’s mother. A person living with dementia may completely forget to eat a meal, or eat a second time, unaware that they just finished a meal. They may prefer fewer nutritionally-rich foods, opting instead for empty-calorie sweet treats and beverages instead. If they are used to preparing their own meals, doing so becomes increasingly inconsistent (leaving out ingredients, for example, or parts of a meal). They may also find it difficult to make grocery shopping selections. Here are some simple guidelines that family caregivers can use to help ensure that individuals like Anna’s mother receive sufficiently healthy nutrition and hydration to best sustain their bodies and minds.
1. Watch for Changing Food Preferences. As dementia progresses, family caregivers may find that the food and drink preferences of the person with dementia are changing. For instance, an individual who used to love braised kale as a side dish to dinner may now be turned off by the odd texture and taste. Try offering a wide variety of healthful foods to see what sparks the interest, and taste buds, of your loved one and work favorite foods in as a routine part of food preparation.
2. Establish Mealtime Routines. Most people, living with dementia or not, have daily mealtime routines. For example, Anna’s mother has always eaten supper as her biggest meal of the day. Since Anna was a girl, supper has been served at 6 o’clock on-the-dot and eaten at the kitchen table. Maintaining mealtime routines may help encourage people with dementia to eat consistently. Straying from these routines can add to confusion and produce anxiety, making eating time a struggle for the caregiver.
3. Make Meals Easy and Enticing  to Eat. Keep healthy finger food snacks (lunch-box-size carrots, fresh fruit, granola bars, celery spread with peanut butter, meatballs, chicken strips, cubed cheese, etc.), in sight and non-healthy treats out of sight. Use aromas to stimulate appetite. Simmer a large kettle of water with added cloves, citrus peel, or cinnamon bark on the stove. Turn on a couple vanilla-scented battery operated candles in the room to add a warm soft glow and enjoyable smell. Make a loaf of bread in a bread machine or bake a batch of oatmeal, raisin, and wheat germ cookies. Fill a pitcher with a spigot (the style often used for sun-brewed tea) with decaf ice tea or water with lemon slices to encourage the consumption of liquids.
4. Maximize Independence. With food preparation skills fading, it is essential to ensure healthy meals are available when your loved one is ready to eat. Consider ordering home-delivered meals and/or find a helper to assist with meal prep. The social interaction provided by the meal delivery person or meal preparer can make mealtime more interesting and enjoyable. Stow prepared dishes in the freezer to use when meal delivery isn’t available. To keep weight loss at bay, consider adding a liquid nutritional supplement to aid in bolstering body nutrients. You might also consider using visual aids such as a red placemat and white plate, providing contrast to help define the eating space.
5. Provide Vitamin Sources and Foods. Taking in essential vitamins and minerals is important especially for older adults who lack vital nutrients. Vitamin B complex is reportedly good for cognition. Research is underway to confirm how Vitamin D may help to clear toxins from the brain. A well-balanced multivitamin along with fresh fruit such as bananas and berries, whole-grain fortified breads, and fresh vegetables, e.g. carrots and leafy greens, can reap positive results. If you have any concerns about the nutritional intake of your loved one suffering from dementia, talk to your doctor about incorporating supplements and additional minerals and supplements, like folic acid and fiber, to aid in digestion. A healthy diet can be a foundation for maintaining the health of an individual with dementia, and with the proper knowledge and routines, family caregivers, like Anna, can make their best effort in dietary management for their loved one.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/frontotemporal-dementia/,Frontotemporal Dementia,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), sometimes also known as frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is one of the most common causes of early-onset dementia. FTD refers collectively to three common clinical syndromes:
behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD)
non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), and
semantic dementia (also known as semantic variant primary progressive aphasia [svPPA])
The brain areas affected by FTD—the frontal and anterior temporal lobes—control reasoning, decision-making, motivation, social graces, behavioral control, personality, emotion, movement, speech, language, and some aspects of memory.
FTD is marked by dramatic changes in personality, behavior, and some thought processes. Changes in personality and social conduct occur in early stages of the disease, including disinhibited and impulsive behavior, apathy, social withdrawal, repetitive/compulsive behavior, and dietary changes. These symptoms may lead to misdiagnosis as a psychological or emotional problem; in the elderly, it can be mistaken for withdrawal or eccentricity.
Like other types of dementia, FTD usually develops slowly and gets gradually worse over several years. In later stages, people can have significant loss of expression, difficulty speaking, and immobility.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/frontotemporal-dementia/,Frontotemporal Dementia,"As many as 7 million Americans may be afflicted with a form of dementia. FTD may account for 2 percent to 5 percent, or 140,000–350,000, cases of dementia, and for as many as 25 percent of dementias that develop before age 65.
FTD affects men and women equally, and onset is usually after age 40 and before age 65. Approximately 40 percent of people diagnosed with FTD have a family history that includes at least one other relative with dementia. There is a strongly inherited genetic link in at least 10 percent of people diagnosed with FTD.
Additionally, a form of dementia in persons with motor neuron disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as ALS or “Lou Gehrig’s Disease”) may be associated with FTD.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/frontotemporal-dementia/,Frontotemporal Dementia,"Initial symptoms of FTD usually include changes in personality and behavior. Still, they vary from person to person, and they depend on the severity and location of the changes in the brain. In most cases, changes to the temporal lobes affect emotions and language, while changes to the frontal lobe often lead to behavioral symptoms and executive function difficulties.
Early on, symptoms can be missed or misunderstood by friends and family. The person you care for may do things and act in ways that are out of character. It’s important to remember that the person with FTD doesn’t have control over these shifts in behavior. They may be unable to recognize their illness and the limitations it brings (known as anosognosia).
Symptoms of FTD can include the following:",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/frontotemporal-dementia/,Frontotemporal Dementia,"Apathy. Lack of initiative and difficulty starting projects, tasks, or activities; lack of interest; or lack of concern. They may neglect domestic, financial, and occupational responsibilities.
Emotional changes. The person’s emotional expression may be shallow (e.g., flat facial expression or lack of emotional response), exaggerated, or inappropriate (e.g., singing, dancing, clapping, or reciting phrases repeatedly).
Social-interpersonal changes. Someone with FTD may struggle with sympathy or empathy. They can have difficulty reading facial expressions and social cues. They may have a diminished response to other people’s needs and feelings and decreased social interest, interrelatedness, or personal warmth.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/frontotemporal-dementia/,Frontotemporal Dementia,"Disinhibition. Socially inappropriate behavior, such as laughing loudly in church, or exhibiting behavior others would not understand or appreciate, like singing or humming in the middle of a work meeting. Other types of behavioral disinhibition include loss of manners and impulsive, rash, or careless actions. The person usually doesn’t perceive these actions as personal or social misconduct.
Executive functioning challenges. Struggling with planning, prioritizing, decision-making, and multi-tasking. They also likely have trouble monitoring themselves, adjusting, and correcting their own behavior. There can be rigid and inflexible thinking and impaired judgment.
Perseveration. Repeating the same word or phrase or doing the same activity over and over.
Compulsions. Repetitive, ritualistic behaviors can sometimes become complex routines. For example, the person with FTD may have rituals of grooming and dressing, while at the same time neglecting proper hygiene.
Hyperorality and dietary changes. The person may binge on food, sometimes taking food from another person’s dish, and increase consumption of alcohol or cigarettes. They may have altered food preferences, such as an increased preference for sweets and junk food. Oral exploration or consumption of inedible objects is also possible.
Utilization behavior. Grabbing objects within reach and starting the appropriate behavior/action associated with the object at an inappropriate time. For example, when conducting an office meeting, the person may see a tape dispenser nearby and begin pulling out strips of tape even if there is no actual need for the tape.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/frontotemporal-dementia/,Frontotemporal Dementia,"Aphasia. The person continues to have the physical ability to speak, but they are unable to understand or use words correctly, fluently express themselves, or use grammar correctly. Someone with aphasia may not comprehend what you say to them. When they speak, they might repeat words or substitute words or syllables. Their speech may not make complete sense.
Dysarthria. Weakness or difficulty controlling the muscles used to speak. Dysarthria causes slurred or slow speech that is difficult to understand.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/frontotemporal-dementia/,Frontotemporal Dementia,"Rigidity. Inability of the muscles to relax normally.
Dystonia. Involuntary muscle contractions that cause slow repetitive movements or abnormal posturing of the limbs or other parts of the body.
Gait disorder. Trouble walking, including “shuffling,” and falls.
Tremor. Shakiness, most often seen in the hands, but possible elsewhere in the body.
Myoclonus. Quick, involuntary jerking of a muscle or group of muscles.
Clumsiness. Dropping things or having trouble holding and working with smaller objects such as buttons, earrings, jewelry clasps, or eyeglass screws.
Apraxia. Inability to perform a familiar movement on command, even though the command is understood, there is a willingness to perform the movement, and there is the capacity to move; in other words, the person cannot simply execute the movement. Apraxia can cause an inability to do common activities, such as using eating utensils or brushing teeth.
Neuromuscular weakness. Severe muscle weakness, cramps, and flickering/twitching.
FTD patients often present two seemingly opposite behavioral profiles in the early and middle stages of the disease. Some people appear restless and lack inhibitions. Others can seem emotionally blunted and apathetic. These differences fade during late stages of the disease.
As the condition advances, so do the effects. Late-stage FTD symptoms include:
A gradual reduction in speech, culminating in mutism.
Inability to respond to verbal commands with motor responses.
Hyperoral tendencies and behaviors.
Swallowing difficulties that can cause coughing, choking, or aspiration.
Falls or immobility due to rigidity or akinesia (loss of muscle movement).",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/frontotemporal-dementia/,Frontotemporal Dementia,"FTD differs from Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia in several ways:
Most people with FTD are diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 65. Alzheimer’s disease usually occurs in people older than 65 and grows more common with increasing age. There is early-onset Alzheimer’s disease, but only 1 in every 20 people with Alzheimer’s disease are under 65.
Memory loss is a prominent early symptom of Alzheimer’s disease. Memory loss is usually not present in early FTD, but patients with advanced FTD can have memory loss.
Behavior changes are a prominent early symptom of FTD. Behavior changes are usually not a major early symptom of Alzheimer’s disease, but they can occur with disease progression, becoming more common in late stages.
Even in the late stages of the disease, FTD patients retain visual-spatial orientation, and they locate and navigate their surroundings accurately. Problems with spatial orientation are more common in Alzheimer’s disease.
Although people with Alzheimer’s disease can have trouble remembering words or names, they usually have less difficulty producing intelligible speech, comprehending the speech of others, or reading than people with FTD.
Life expectancy is slightly longer for people with FTD.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/frontotemporal-dementia/,Frontotemporal Dementia,"Diagnosis of FTD is based on evaluation by a doctor familiar with FTD and other dementias. The diagnostic evaluation usually includes a detailed assessment of symptoms, neurological exam, cognitive testing (also known as neuropsychological testing), blood testing, and brain scans or imaging.
Computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveal atrophy in the frontal and temporal regions of the brain. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT scans) may reveal dysfunction of the frontal lobes, such as decreased metabolism or blood flow.
Blood testing is frequently done to evaluate for common, treatable conditions (e.g., nutritional deficiencies, thyroid function changes, chronic infections) that can cause similar symptoms to FTD.
Lumbar puncture and spinal fluid testing are sometimes recommended to rule-out Alzheimer’s disease, which can sometimes cause symptoms that mimic FTD.
Neuropsychological testing helps measure performance in different areas of cognitive function (memory, learning, language, visual-spatial abilities, executive function, and behavior), which could be helpful for diagnosis and measuring disease severity. Neuropsychological testing of a person with FTD could show:
Decreased mental effort and concern. Some people impulsively respond to test items or quickly abandon participation in tests. Other people may be slow, inert, and persistent.
Conversation is stilted. Verbal responses can be short and lack detail. Some people make mechanical, repetitive remarks, echo words spoken by others, or repeat responses.
Apathetic patients may speak with a weak or flat voice. Patterns of speaking can be halting or awkward.
Overactive patients may have uninhibited and uncensored speech. If you speak to them, they may respond inappropriately (or not at all). It’s not that they don’t understand – they aren’t paying attention.
Some people have changes in their physical speaking ability, such as slurred speech or difficulty making accurate movements when speaking.
Some people lose their grammatical processing or the meaning of words, which can impact speaking and comprehension.
Visual-spatial skills remain normal, except for those compromised by behavioral changes.
Memory is usually normal but may be involved later in the disease. Difficulties with attention, concentration, and mental effort, which commonly occur in FTD, can sometimes mimic short-term memory difficulties.
Executive function (attention, concentration, verbal and design fluency, planning, judgment, problem solving, response inhibition) and abstract thinking are impaired.
Apathetic patients may speak with a weak or flat voice. Patterns of speaking can be halting or awkward.
Overactive patients may have uninhibited and uncensored speech. If you speak to them, they may respond inappropriately (or not at all). It’s not that they don’t understand – they aren’t paying attention.

Some people lose their grammatical processing or the meaning of words, which can impact speaking and comprehension.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/frontotemporal-dementia/,Frontotemporal Dementia,"Researchers are studying ways to diagnose frontotemporal disorders earlier and more accurately. They are developing biomarkers (new blood tests, spinal fluid tests, and advanced brain imaging) to improve diagnosis, measure rate of disease progression, and measure efficacy of treatment. Researchers are also expanding neuropsychological testing to improve assessment of cognitive and behavioral changes in people with FTD.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/frontotemporal-dementia/,Frontotemporal Dementia,"The length of FTD varies, with some patients declining rapidly over two to three years and others showing slowly progressive changes over a decade. Studies have shown that persons with FTD live with the disease for an average of eight years, ranging from two years to 17 years.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/frontotemporal-dementia/,Frontotemporal Dementia,"No medications are known currently to treat, prevent, or slow the advancement of FTD. Serotonin-boosting medications may alleviate some behaviors.
Non-pharmacological behavioral management strategies, such as redirection or distraction, can also be used to direct behavior in a positive way. Ask the physician about therapies – medicinal, physical, occupational, speech/language, swallowing, or alternative / complementary – that they would recommend to help the person you care for.
Researchers are actively searching for new treatments and running clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of these treatments. If interested in clinical trial participation, please discuss this with the physician. They can connect you to resources to learn more about trial participation and help you decide if taking part in a trial is right for the person you care for.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/frontotemporal-dementia/,Frontotemporal Dementia,"It’s vital for you, as the caregiver, to have breaks and time off from constant caregiving demands. Self care is essential for your own mental and physical health, and it supports your ability to care for your friend or family member when they need you.
Start with the basics: Stay hydrated, make healthy eating choices, prioritize getting enough sleep, and ensure you are getting your regular health screenings and check-ups.
Plan your breaks and time away from caregiving. Respite care (care of your friend or family member during your time away) can be arranged with the help of a friend or family member – you may want to consider the support of a home health worker.
Ask for help. Some organizations even have programs to support respite care to ensure the primary caregiver gets time away. The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) offers several types of grants – one of which helps cover the costs of short-term respite care for full-time, unpaid caregivers. HFC has a care grant program to cover the cost of short-term professional, in-home respite care.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/grandma-doesnt-remember-me/,Grandma doesn’t remember me,"How does having a family member with dementia affect children? The answer: It depends on the age of the child, the severity of the memory loss and the child’s relationship to the person with dementia. The better you understand how the disease affects your loved one, and how you handle your own process of loss and adapting to change, the better you can help your child.
Depending on their age, children understand only what they are developmentally capable of understanding. But they will also benefit by knowing the truth—as described in their terms. Accepting and acknowledging the truth requires that we allow ourselves to experience feelings of loss. When caring for a person with dementia, the feeling of loss is quite complicated and is often called “ambiguous loss”—it is unclear and indeterminate. The ambiguity comes from needing to recognize that the person might be here physically, but absent psychologically and cognitively. Often our greatest paradox as caregivers is the paradox of letting go of the person who used to be, and holding on to the qualities of the person who is present now. How you meet this challenge will significantly influence your child’s ability to find a pleasurable connection–throughout the disease process–with the person they love.
Children and teens often receive less attention, have their routines disrupted and may have to help with caregiving responsibilities. Children’s grief comes out differently than adults’ grief, depending on their developmental stage. When children don’t have information, they make up explanations for the things happening around them. They might experience sadness, confusion, fear, worry, anger, frustration, guilt, jealousy, resentment and embarrassment. They may feel unloved, that they are not normal and/or their family is not normal, concern that the illness or disability is “contagious,” and even that they caused this disease to happen.
Children may have difficulty understanding and accepting the disease, particularly a disease as confusing as dementia. They might withdraw from or lose patience with the person with dementia or spend more time away from home or not invite friends to the house if the person with dementia lives with you. Often they express vague physical complaints like a stomach ache or headache, show regressive (younger) behavior and you might see a decline in their school work. Sometimes children quietly worry that the disease will “happen” to them or mommy or daddy, and if so, who will take care of them.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/grandma-doesnt-remember-me/,Grandma doesn’t remember me,"Parents need to maintain open lines of communication with children, explaining the disease more than once and answering questions truthfully. Children need comfort and support and the opportunity to express their feelings. Normalizing their feelings by naming them and accepting them keeps the channels of communication open. It also helps children if the adults in their lives express their own feelings, to show them that feelings are ok and there are appropriate ways to express those feelings.
Preschool children and young children will express themselves best through play and art activities. They often sense something is wrong but have no way of asking what it is, so it’s best not to pretend all is well. Use simple and concrete explanations such as, “If grandma doesn’t remember things as well as she used to, we may need to help her.” Or “Grandma’s brain is having trouble remembering and the doctors are trying to help her.”
School-aged children often want a lot of detail about the disease and might respond well to pictures of the brain of an Alzheimer’s person. They might be particularly upset by the many mood swings and behavior problems of someone with dementia. They need us to help them identify their feelings, discuss their reactions to the person with dementia without judgment, and help them understand why their beloved grandparent is behaving the way he or she is. Give the child the opportunity to help in problem solving, such as “How can we help grandma not be scared when she goes outside?” It is also important to not give children responsibilities beyond their capabilities (e.g., taking grandma to the bathroom). The school-aged child needs reminders that the person with dementia still loves them even if he or she doesn’t say so or even remember the child’s name.
For teenagers, the many mood changes of the person with dementia may be similar to the ones they themselves are experiencing. Adolescence tends to be a self-centered time and it might be hard for the teenager to be patient with the changes in their loved one and with the accommodations necessary at home to care for someone with dementia. Listen and be understanding and tolerant of their negative feelings. Bring your teenager into the planning process so they feel they have some control. As with all children, information is important. Teenagers can understand a more complex explanation of the disease. Work with your teenager on schedules to accommodate their needs and yours, and give them some control on what chores they might have. Having specific tasks to do for the person with dementia can help the teenager to feel more comfortable, e.g. reading a story, looking at photo albums, folding laundry, etc. “Fitting in” is of primary importance to many teenagers and having someone with dementia in the home may be a source of profound embarrassment. These feelings need to be acknowledged and accommodations made to allow the teenager to socialize with as much dignity for him or herself and the person with dementia as possible. They may need to help finding words to explain the disease to friends.
It is important in all families and for all children that there be sources of support, whether it be extended family, friends, religious community or counselor. It is very easy to be consumed by the responsibilities of being a caregiver. As a family, make sure you plan fun activities to do together (sometimes, at least, without the person with dementia) and have alone time with your child as often as possible. Doing research on the web or reading books together on dementia is another way to help everyone in the family gain knowledge and share their feelings and experiences. Click here to see a list of recommended books. Other recommended books can be found by searching the web.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/grief-and-loss/,Grief and Loss,"We generally think of grief as a reaction to a death. But there is another grief that comes from loss while someone is still living. This grief is often experienced when caring for someone with a chronic illness. Chronic illness, and particularly any illness that impairs a person’s cognitive ability, causes caregivers and loved ones to experience grief and loss right now. In this fact sheet, we will discuss the grief related to death and dying, and grief associated with chronic illness. It is natural to grieve the death of a loved one before, during, and after the actual time of their passing. The process of accepting the unacceptable is what grieving is all about.",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/grief-and-loss/,Grief and Loss,"Over time, with most chronic illnesses, there are changes in a person’s abilities. Whether it is someone living with Parkinson’s disease who can no longer button a shirt, or someone coping with diabetes who has to follow a special diet, or someone with Alzheimer’s disease who can’t remember who you are, caregivers have to adjust to the needs of the care receiver. Caregivers may experience many kinds of losses: loss of independence; loss of control; loss of the future as it had been imagined; loss of financial security; loss of the relationship as it once was; loss of freedom, sleep, and family harmony; loss of someone to share chores and other tasks with; or simply the loss of someone to talk things over with. Persons with chronic illnesses also have to adjust to many of the same losses, but also—loss of dignity, mobility, a carefully planned future or retirement, a loss of roles that were played, or the loss of a sense of worth (all depending on what disability is associated with the illness).
It is easy to ignore these losses and just keep doing the things that need to be done. However, these losses lead to grief, and grief can lead to sadness, depression, anger, guilt, sleeplessness, and other physical and emotional problems. It is important to identify our losses, identify our feelings, and let ourselves grieve the changes that have happened in our lives. When we can do this, our feelings will less often erupt as angry outbursts weighed down by guilt, or creep over us as depression and hopelessness; they instead can more easily be expressed as a shared loss of something treasured—which family and friends close to the situation can likely empathize with, leading to deeper communication and stronger relationships with those going through the loss with you.
Writing in a journal can help you to name and express your feelings about these losses. You can combine it with a gratitude journal—things that you are thankful for. Prayer, meditation, relaxation exercises, attending a support group (or simply talking with a friend or counselor), or creating a ritual can help you to let go of the intensity of the feelings so that you can grieve but also heal.",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/grief-and-loss/,Grief and Loss,"Ambiguous loss is what we experience when someone is still “there” but also not “there.” This is mainly experienced when someone has a cognitive impairment from dementia, a traumatic brain injury, or a stroke. We also experience ambiguous loss when someone with dementia has “moments of lucidity,” when he/she is clear and makes sense for a short period of time. It is hard not to think that if they can do this every once in awhile, they ought to be able to do it all of the time. When they return to their confused state, we often experience anger, frustration, and disappointment—renewed grief.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/grief-and-loss/,Grief and Loss,"When caring for someone over time, we may start to grieve that person long before they die, we grieve the loss of the person’s “former self.” Experiencing loss on a daily basis, as well as anticipating the loss at the end of life, knowing what is coming, can be just as painful as the loss associated with a death. Caregivers may experience guilt or shame for “wishing it were over” or thinking of their loved one as already “gone” (particularly when someone has a cognitive impairment). It is important to recognize these feelings as normal. Ultimately, anticipatory grief is a way of allowing us to prepare emotionally for the inevitable. Preparing for the death of a loved one can allow family members to contemplate and clear unresolved issues, make end of life plans for funeral and burial, and experience their pain in stages. Sometimes, when someone has grieved a death over a long period, there is less grief when the person dies; sometimes there is more pain when a person dies.",depression
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/grief-and-loss/,Grief and Loss,"Grief is a natural emotion, a universal experience that makes us human. Because it is intense and uncomfortable to feel, we often try to find ways to avoid experiencing the immensity of the emotion—through distraction and busyness. We grieve because we are deprived of a loved one; the sense of loss is profound, the change in roles is confounding, and we may become uncertain of our identity. Often caregivers are in the situation of having to make changes in their circumstances—where to live, financial concerns, relationships—along with fear of not knowing what lies ahead.
Grief lasts a long time. Recent research has shown that intense grieving lasts from three months to a year and many people continue experiencing profound grief for two years or more. Our society expects us to be “doing fine” in about two weeks. It is common to think there is something wrong with us if our grief “lasts too long.” The grieving process depends on our belief system, religion, life experiences, and the type of loss suffered. Many faiths and cultures have rituals for recognizing grief and loss during at least the first year after a death. We also expect other family members to show their grief in the same way we do, even when we can say that everyone grieves differently. There is no right or wrong way to grieve; grief is an individual process. Many people find solace in sharing their grief with family and friends; others find solace by attending grief support groups offered in every community through their local hospice (even if you did not have hospice services). If you are feeling overwhelmed and concerned about your own grief process over time, seek professional help.
When someone dies suddenly, our first response is often denial, then shock, confusion, and pain. Fatal heart attacks and strokes, car accidents, and suicide can leave family members troubled and searching for answers. In these cases, family members may be left with unresolved issues, such as guilt, anger, anxiety, despair, and feelings of emptiness. Sometimes we have to learn to forgive ourselves and our loved one who died. It can take longer to heal from this loss and it is important to give yourself time to grieve before pushing yourself to “move on.” Getting support from family, clergy, friends, and grief groups can help.",depression

Be available. Offer support in an unobtrusive but persistent manner.
Listen without giving advice.
Do not offer stories of your own experiences with grief. This can have the effect of dismissing the grieving person’s pain.
Allow the grieving person to use expressions of anger or bitterness, including such expressions against God. This may be normal behavior in an attempt to find meaning in what has happened.
Realize that no one can replace or undo the loss. To heal, the individual must endure the grief process. Allow him/her to feel the pain.
Be patient, kind, and understanding without being patronizing. Don’t claim to “know” what the other person is feeling.
Don’t force the individual to share feelings if he/she doesn’t want to.
Physical and emotional touch can bring great comfort to the bereaved. Don’t hesitate to share a hug or handclasp when appropriate.
Be there later, when friends and family have all gone back to their routines.
Remember holidays, birthdays, and anniversaries that have important meaning for the bereaved. Offer support during this time.
Don’t be afraid of reminding the person of the loss; he/she is already thinking about it. Share stories and memories of the deceased.
Send cards, flowers, deliver a meal, offer to do chores, donate to a cause that is important to the person who died or who is grieving.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/grief-and-loss-along-way/,Grief and Loss Along the Way,"Someone once said that aging is a narcissistic wound, meaning that the changes and losses that come with aging—our own or someone’s we love—affect us deeply in ways that are sometimes hard to deal with. This doesn’t mean that there are not positive parts to aging, but when we experience these losses, we sometimes need to stop and reflect on them. Many losses are subtle or ambiguous.
And even if a loved one is still with us, we may experience grief and loss as the person we care for loses the ability to do things. These losses along the way need to be grieved much like a death needs to be grieved. At the same time, we might be experiencing some of our own losses due to not working, aging and caregiving.
Some of the losses that come with age include: someone to listen to us; friendship/companionship; independence/autonomy; freedom; health; lifestyle; money; identity (particularly from a career); self esteem; beauty/body image; dignity; home; driving; memory; future; faith/hope; community; hobbies/sports/pastimes; sex; senses—particularly hearing, vision and taste; pleasures; pets.
Sometimes we deal with grief/sadness by over or undereating or sleeping, crying, talking with friends or professionals, over or underworking, over-consumption of alcohol or other drugs. In order to take care of ourselves, we often need to think of ways that we can nurture ourselves, especially during a time of grief. In fact, creating a time to grieve may be the most important thing we can do.
One way to help yourself is to do something different, often by yourself, just for yourself. Taking a break (utilizing respite care), going on a trip, taking a walk—particularly in nature—gardening, exercise (for some people sports are a way to work problems out). Being very kind to yourself, such as getting a massage, facial, pedicure or manicure can be soothing. Prayer/meditation, reading, art and dance can help. Cuddling your pet can be just what is needed to feel connected. Getting together with friends, family or religious communities can help immensely.
Sometimes, when caregiving takes over our lives, we forget to take care of our health.  Making an appointment with your doctor might be just what is needed.
If you feel depressed, stop and pay attention: This is our body’s way of saying we need to do something. Learning to say no and setting boundaries helps us to feel more in control.  Don’t forget to do things that bring pleasure, including sex. Listen to music, see a movie, laugh, cry.
Professional help is available when other coping mechanisms are not working.  Make a list of what works for you and keep it handy so you can refer to it when you are having a hard time. Here in the Bay Area, FCA provides short-term counseling for caregivers to help deal with caregiving issues.
Grief over your losses is a natural and understandable part of caregiving.  It is important to pay attention and feel the feelings. Then we can begin to heal.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/guidelines-better-communication-brain-impaired-adults/,Guidelines for Better Communication with Brain-Impaired Adults,"Communicating with a loved one with a brain disorder can indeed be challenging. Finding the right words and getting your point across are difficult under normal circumstances.This difficulty is often compounded by your role as a caregiver. And although there are no easy solutions, following some basic guidelines should ease communication, and lower levels of stress both for you and for the care recipient.
1. Make Sure You Have Their Attention. 
Statements and questions made to adults with a brain impairment should almost always begin with an identifier. This doesn’t necessarily have to be the person’s name, but should be a common greeting used between the two of you (very often, a term of endearment will work). For example, start a sentence with “Mom,” then pause. Wait till you have her attention before continuing, especially if there is a great deal of background noise. Very often, it is difficult for impaired individuals to understand when people are talking around them, or to them.
2. Speak at Eye Level and Enunciate.
In addition to getting the individual’s attention, you also need to retain that attention. Before beginning even a short conversation, get to his or her eye level. If someone is in a wheelchair or lying down, pull up a chair. Be sure to retain eye contact and try not to occupy yourself with other things while you’re engaged in conversation. Enunciate your words so that each is differentiated from the other.
3. Use Simple, Direct Statements.
When communicating, statements should be short and descriptive. Instead of, “Mom, I would appreciate it if you finished your breakfast and got ready because we’re running late,” try, “Mom, please finish up so we can leave on time.” The latter may sound curt, but it needn’t take an angry or frustrated tone. It is simply a direct way of communicating your needs. And be sure to use sentences containing short-action increments. Rather than, “Please take off your shirt,” try “Can you help me unbutton the front?” “Good.” “Now can you pull your arm out of the sleeve?” “Thank you.” Etc.
4. Ask. Try Not to Tell.
Even when parenting is your formal role — you are taking care of an adult child, for example — keep in mind that you are still communicating with an adult. And most adults like to be asked to do something, rather than told what to do. As such, utilize the three magic words: “can,” “will,” and “please.” “Can you stand up so I can fix your dress?” “Will you sit in this chair?” “Please join me in the living room.”
5. Move Closer.
If you are talking to a loved one and they can’t hear what you’re saying, try moving closer to the person rather than raising your voice. Be respectful of a person’s “personal space” (or distance at which she/he likes to communicate). But remember the ultimate goal: making yourself understood.
6. Talk Around Difficulties and Use Gestures.
Brain-impaired individuals have very often lost part or all of their “sensory repertoire”—the sense of everyday things, people, and places. If your loved one cannot remember a person or place, try to avoid thinking or expressing negative feelings that convey your frustration or worry. Instead, talk around the word by using a vague pronoun reference, e.g. he, she, or it. And use (as well as listen to) gestures. A person with a brain impairment might be telling you about a house down the street, but may have lost the word “house.” He may instead put the tips of his fingers together in the shape of a roof. Suggest words that seem appropriate and be receptive to feedback. If you truly get stuck, focus on the emotion being expressed. “It sounds like what you saw was beautiful.”
7. Talk with, Rather Than About.
Persons with brain impairment very often get pushed to the side during conversation. People, even professionals, may feel uncomfortable about talking to an impaired individual because they’re not sure what will be understood. As a caregiver, make the care recipient the focus of your conversation. Encourage others to talk with your loved one, rather than about them. If someone continually refuses to talk directly to your loved one, a gentle reminder is appropriate. Additionally, it is okay for caregivers to cover more technical questions with a professional before or after your scheduled appointment time.
8. Listen.
A simple point, but one not to be overlooked. You know your loved one better than anyone else; use this to your advantage. As a caregiver, very often your most important role is as a listener. And listening can be done even if your loved one does not speak; you can communicate your interest with as little as holding their hand.
9. Give Yourself Plenty of Time.
Time, and the freedom to take your time, is a necessity. For example, allow an extra 15 minutes for travel, enough to assist your loved one in getting to, from, into and out of the car. This is especially important if the care recipient is particularly resistive or hesitant to participate in her or his own care (taking a shower, for example). Try not to get into a power struggle and maintain your other communication skills. When brain-impaired individuals are rushed, they tend to get stressed. And stress very often makes people less amenable to care.
10. Try, Try Again.
A little trite, but important nonetheless. If, as a caregiver, you find yourself in a power struggle with a loved one, it is okay to let go. Come back in five minutes. If you are assisting your parent in going outside, for example, and they resist putting on a coat, give in. Engage in another activity for five or ten minutes, such as putting on your own coat, and then come back and try again. In that five or ten minutes, your loved one may have forgotten why it was so important to resist in putting on a coat in the first place, and may go along with your request.",dementia

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hands-skills-caregivers/,Hands-On Skills for Caregivers,"When you’re a caregiver, finding time to take care of your own physical needs is difficult enough, but taking care of the physical needs of someone else is even more challenging. Assisting someone else to dress, bathe, sit, or stand when they are upset, agitated, or combative—often the case when caring for someone with a brain disorder such as Alzheimer’s disease—requires special strategies. The following five techniques can make taking care of a loved one’s physical needs easier.
Approach from the front and retain eye contact 
When assisting someone physically, do not approach him/her from behind or from the side. This can startle and confuse the person in your care, leading to increased levels of agitation and/or paranoia. Instead, approach from the front. Touch the care recipient on the shoulder, upper arm or hand, and tell them what’s going on. Use a calm voice to walk him/her through the whole process. For example, “Okay, let’s stand up. Good. Next, we are going to… .” Retain eye contact throughout the duration of the activity.
Elicit your loved one’s help 
Even when frail, your loved one might be able to shift his/her weight or move his/her arms or legs to make physically assisting them easier. Some examples are: “We’re getting ready to stand now, Mom, so lean forward as far as you can,” or, “Can you move your leg, honey, so I can change the sheet?” A little help from them means a lot less work for you.
Allow the person to finish what they’re doing 
If, as a caregiver, you are running late, the tendency is to hurry your loved one, too. However, this rushed atmosphere is very difficult for care recipients, especially those who suffer from memory loss or brain impairment. Though you may try to sound calm and encouraging, it’s easy for loved ones to pick up our “anxious vibes.” So, even if running late, allow some time to finish the current activity before moving onto the next. For example, “Mom, after you finish that last bite of cereal, we’re going to get you dressed and ready to see your friends.”
Utilize the major muscle groups 
When physically assisting a loved one, pulling or supporting them by their hands or arms is not only difficult, but may lead to injury for you and them. Instead, utilize the major muscle groups.
For example, when taking someone for a walk, stand directly behind and to the left of him or her. Place your left hand on their left shoulder, and your right hand on their right shoulder. In this way you are walking with your loved one in a comforting hug rather than pulling or pushing them. And when turning someone in a bed, contract your abdominals to maintain your back straight, while using your shoulder and leg muscles. Pull them toward you with your right hand over their hip or at the knee, and your left hand at their shoulder. Finally, when pulling someone to a standing position, it’s best to use a transfer belt (one can be purchased at any medical supply store for around twenty dollars).
Once they are sitting at the edge of the bed or chair, pull up on the transfer belt, “hugging” your loved one close, again, utilizing their large muscle groups in the shoulders and the back. Remember to keep your back straight and to always change position by moving your feet, rather than twisting at the waist. And before going home from your next doctor’s appointment, ask for a referral to an occupational therapist who can help you develop your transferring skills.
Allow for their reality 
Remember to accept your loved one’s reality, even when assisting with a physical task. If, for example, your spouse becomes shy because he/she thinks that you are a sibling and doesn’t want to get undressed in front of you, don’t force the situation. Try leaving the room and coming back in a couple of minutes. Perhaps on a second or third attempt your spouse will recognize you and be amenable to your care. If all else fails, consider the situation. Is it an emergency? Changing a loved one’s soiled garments cannot be delayed. However, if a care recipient is being difficult and doesn’t want to take a bath or wash his/her hair on a particular day, that’s okay. Plan on doing it at a later time that day or the next day, when your loved one may accept your help.
Finally, don’t try to physically assist with caregiving unless you can. Injuring yourself will not help the situation, and will often make your caregiving responsibilities that much more difficult. If you find yourself in a nonemergency situation where you are unable to physically assist your loved one (for example, after he/she slides from their chair to the floor) call your local fire department and request a “fireman’s assist.” They will come to your house and help you. If it is an emergency situation (where either you or your loved one are injured), contact the paramedics by calling 911.",dementia

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiring-home-help/,Hiring In-Home Help,"Long-Distance caregiving, working full-time and caregiving and/or caring for someone 24 hours a day/7 days a week will take a toll on anyone. With a loved one who needs personal care and who can’t be left alone, you must be vigilant and “on duty” day and night. With constant care and companionship responsibilities, you may have very little time to yourself. If you are caring for someone who needs to be transferred from bed to wheelchair or out of a chair when sitting, you may be at risk for injuring your back. For those caring for a family member living with dementia, you may be also be dealing with challenging behavior, wandering risks, or actions that might be harmful or dangerous such as leaving cooking burners on. If you don’t have time to do the shopping, banking, and taking care of your own medical needs, you are at risk for stress-related illness. Are housekeeping routines and cooking being done with great difficulty or being left undone?
Consider your needs as a caregiver and the needs of the person you are caring for. Here are the main areas to assess:
Personal care: Bathing, eating, dressing, toileting, grooming
Household care: Cooking, cleaning, laundry, shopping
Health care: Medication management, physician’s appointments, physical therapy
Emotional care: Companionship, meaningful activities, conversation
Hiring help can relieve you of some of the tasks you are responsible for, freeing you to have some time for yourself. Having trusted help can give you the opportunity to run errands, go to the doctor for yourself, catch up on sleep, and socialize with friends. For long-distance caregivers and working caregivers, help can provide the care and assistance needed when you can’t be there on a daily basis yourself. Interestingly, caregivers have found that in some instances the person receiving care can be more cooperative with someone other than the primary caregiver, so that, for example, taking a shower might not be the battle that it can otherwise be. Engaging an attendant can help to preserve your relationship as daughter or partner, rather than always having to be the chore person or task master. Attendants come in fresh for a certain number of hours and therefore have the energy to be engaging and encouraging in a way you might be too exhausted to do around the clock.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiring-home-help/,Hiring In-Home Help,"It can be hard for your loved one to accept help from a stranger. Initially, it will be important for you to be present to help the attendant and the care receiver to establish a successful relationship. You can show the attendant how you do things, so the help that is given will feel familiar and comfortable. Let your loved one know that YOU need help, and that this is something they can do to help you care for them. Reassure your loved one that hiring help does not signal that you are going to abandon them.
If your loved one lives alone, you might hear, “I don’t need any help.” Suggest that it will make YOU feel more comfortable knowing someone is there part of the day. You can also suggest that they “just try it for a week.” This will give your loved one some control in decision making and help them be open to having an attendant.
The transition to an attendant might be easier if the attendant shares a similar cultural background or language. The care receiver may have a preference for a male or female attendant. However, wonderful attendants come from all backgrounds, and being open to a caring, competent attendant from a different ethnicity or cultural background than your own can lead to rewarding bonds.
Sometimes the best way to get an attendant accepted is to hire a “housekeeper.” Care receivers are often more open to having someone come in and “help” with the housework before they are willing to accept someone to help with personal care. This gives your loved one time to become familiar with the attendant and build trust.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiring-home-help/,Hiring In-Home Help,"We all react differently to interacting with someone we don’t know. For some people, meeting someone new is an enjoyable and interesting opportunity. But for others who are naturally more reticent or are feeling vulnerable due to their illness, there is great reluctance to exposing their private life and personal living space.
Hiring someone through an agency will give you some choice for attendant selection. Most agencies have done background checks and bonded the people who work for them—be sure to ask if this is the case. And if you feel uncomfortable with the person who is sent, you can always ask the agency to send someone else. But typically an agency will attempt to match the attendant to your specific needs and requests, so if you aren’t immediately comfortable with the attendant sent, consider giving it a day or two to warm up to them.
Caregivers and care receivers often worry that their belongings will be stolen. This does happen, but it is much rarer than you might be led to believe. Lock up or take out of the house any especially valuable belongings, such as heirloom jewelry, just to make yourself less anxious about this happening. Keep track of cash and checks/checkbooks/credit cards. If hiring through a homecare agency report any concerns you might have. If hiring privately, schedule a time to discuss the concerns directly with the caregiver. If your loved one has dementia, they may report an item as “missing” when it is only misplaced or stashed away.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiring-home-help/,Hiring In-Home Help,"There are formal and informal ways of finding an attendant. The formal way is to contact a Home Care Agency located near to where your loved one lives. A long list of agencies will be available in most urban and suburban communities. This can make it difficult to figure out who to contact first. Far fewer agencies serve rural areas, limiting options for hiring care. People who can help you select the right agency for your needs include your doctor and their staff, your friends/family who have used an agency, and others in your community whom you trust, such as your faith community, your local senior center, etc. Also check for agency reviews from trusted online sources, and consider contacting your local Area Agency on Aging to ask whom they hold contract(s) with for their clients.
Key questions to ask:
Is the agency licensed by the state? (Many but not all states require licensing to operate a Home Care Agency). Ask how long they have been in business.
Are the workers licensed and insured? How does the agency train, supervise, and monitor their workers?
Request that the agency send you a packet of information that describes their services, fees, and a list of references. This will give you an opportunity to review the information before sitting face to face with an agency representative.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiring-home-help/,Hiring In-Home Help,"Pros:
Screening, hiring/firing, pay, taxes are handled through the agency
Note: Some agencies work as “employment agencies,” and their workers are contractors, not employees of the agency. Be clear on what the agency covers, e.g. payroll, liability insurance, workmen’s compensation insurance, unemployment insurance. Ask for evidence of their insurance.
Can offer attendants with a variety of skills and match you with a staff member who can provide the care or help that you need
Able to accommodate variable schedules that might be inconsistent or unpredictable at times
If worker is sick/goes on vacation, agency will provide a substitute
If worker is not the right fit, can send an alternate choice
Can help settle disputes with you/attendant
Often covered by long-term care insurance
Cons:
May schedule more than one attendant if work hours are not consistent, needing to separately orient and adjust to each new person
May experience more staff turnover
May limit or charge more for certain tasks
Typically more expensive than private hire
The informal way of finding help is to hire an attendant privately. This entails your finding your own attendant and being responsible for hiring/firing/payroll taxes, and all aspects of being an employer. Attendants are most often found through word of mouth—friends, your community, and some non-profit senior organizations. Attendants available for work may also list their services on online listing services and on bulletin boards in Senior Centers and other places. Local colleges and in particular nursing programs, community college HHA (Home Health Aide)/CNA (Certified Nursing Assistant) programs are good sources of available talent. If you are hiring privately, it is essential that you do a background check (See FCA fact sheet Background Checking: Resources That Help). Check your home owners or apartment insurance for liability coverage. You may need to add it and also get workmen’s compensation insurance.
Key questions to ask:
What are the aide’s credentials? Check with the credentialing body to confirm.
Where has the aide worked previously? Ask for two to three references from former or current employers.
Always contact the references asking about the care competency, compassion, and reliability of the worker.
Is the aide legally eligible to work in this country? Ask to see verification (passport, green card, etc.)",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiring-home-help/,Hiring In-Home Help,"Pros:
You choose the person you want from a pool you have screened, and you are the “boss”
More flexibility in tasks that can be performed
Typically less expensive than going through an agency
Greater opportunity to build a long-term relationship with the attendant(s)
Cons:
If worker is sick, it is your responsibility to find alternate help
You are responsible for all aspects of being an employer: hiring/firing, payroll, taxes, insurance, and employee disputes
May not be covered by long-term care insurance",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiring-home-help/,Hiring In-Home Help,"The rules for hired help vary from state to state, and sometimes city to city. Start with state Department of Labor. You will need to familiarize yourself the regulations in the municipality where the help or care will be provided. First, find out what the minimum wage is in your area. Second, determine how many hours of help you require. In some states, if someone works more than 8 hours/day, they are eligible to be paid time and a half for 8–16 hours, and double time for 16–24 hours. If you have live-in help, some states require that the attendant get 5 hours of uninterrupted sleep. So, if you have a loved one who is up a lot at night, you might have to hire a nighttime attendant in order to give the daytime attendant a break. In other states you can hire someone for a “per diem” or “shift” rate, for example $250/day for someone to be there 24/7, instead of an hourly rate. Third, if you hire privately, you will need to set up a payroll (see above). Some attendants prefer to be paid with a 1099 at the end of the year. This means they will be responsible for their own taxes. Be sure that they meet the local requirements for an independent contractor. Finally, some attendants will accept payment only in cash.
If you hire a Home Care Agency, they will establish the pay rate. Agencies will charge a different amount, depending on the kind of care that is needed, e.g. personal care versus dementia care. Also, an agency might have a minimum number of hours, for example, only 4-hour shifts. Or they will do a 2-hour shift but charge more per hour. For people who need full-time care, the options are a “live-in” who does the full 24 hours, a live-in plus an 8-hour shift for someone who needs someone to be awake and available during the night, two 12-hour shifts for people who may need someone awake at night, or three 8-hour shifts for someone who may need extra help due to heavy care needs.
Caregivers often ask whether they should pay the attendant if they take a vacation. Or if they should give a monetary or physical gift at holidays. Are yearly bonuses expected? If the attendant is terminated, not for cause, should they pay severance? These are individual decisions but important things to think about so you are not burdened with trying to figure them out when the time comes.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiring-home-help/,Hiring In-Home Help,"Hiring in-home help can be expensive, particularly if you need full-time help. However, if you only need four hours once or twice a week, it can be more affordable—the hourly cost varies depending on where you live in the United States.
If the care receiver has a long-term care insurance policy and the service provided meets the policy criteria, the benefits can offset the cost. Check the policy for how many days of care are required before the policy will start to pay. Determine whether there is coverage for hiring someone privately, or only for hiring through an agency. Some policies require that the attendant be a HHA, LVN (licensed vocational nurse) or CNA, and others do not.
The cost of a hired attendant might be tax deductible if it is considered medically necessary. Check with your tax accountant to see if this is the case in your situation.
If the care receiver is low income and qualifies for Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California), they may be able to get help through an in-home program called In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS). Check with your local Medicaid office to see what services are available in your area. Medicaid benefits differ by state.
This type of care is an appropriate expenditure for use of the care receivers’ personal savings. Often family will also contribute as needed to help cover the cost. Holding a family meeting to discuss the need for the home care service, the cost of the care, and the means available to cover the cost can help surface concerns from family members, and gain support to help cover the expense.
Some communities have sliding scale or low-cost home care through specialized funding. Contact your local Area Agency on Aging (AAA) to see what is available in your community. The Medicaid In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) office may have a registry that is open to the public and can give you referrals for pre-screened attendants. Under Title IIIE of the Older Americans Act, funding distributed through your local Area Agency on Aging (AAA) offers help paying for respite care (temporary relief) and other caregiver related services. Faith communities and some senior service agencies also might be able to help you find lower cost attendant care in your area.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiring-home-help/,Hiring In-Home Help,"When hiring help, it is important to be clear about what it is you want the attendant to do. Write a job description that spells out the things you need help with and make a detailed list of the tasks you want done. Clarity is essential to effective communication and mutual understanding. For example, if you want help with housekeeping, list the kind of housekeeping duties that need to be performed—vacuuming, cleaning the bathroom, washing dishes, doing the laundry, etc. Be clear about any specific ways that you want these duties performed, e.g. wash white items and colors separately. If you want personal care, does the care receiver need help with dressing, grooming, bathing, toileting, transferring? If you want someone to just “be there,” does the care receiver like to take walks, watch TV (what shows?), talk, go out to lunch, play golf, read, be left alone (some people like chatty attendants and some people do not)? If there is a pet, does it need to be taken for a walk, do you want the poop in the backyard cleaned up, the kitty box cleaned out? (Check with the attendant for allergies to pets or fear of certain animals.). It is very important to find out the attendant’s experience with dementia if you are hiring someone to care for a loved one with cognitive impairment. Give examples of situations you face and ask how they would handle them. (See below: “Write a Job Description”)
Three general certifications exist for home care attendants. One is an HHA—home health aide, the second is a CNA—certified nursing assistant, and the third is an LVN—licensed vocational nurse. They are trained to provide most levels of care in the home except for care requiring a registered nurse, e.g. giving an injection. Each state has different laws on what attendants can and cannot do, such as dressing changes on a wound or giving medications. In most settings, an attendant can put the medications in the care receiver’s hand, but the care receiver must take the medications on their own. However, there might be rules on who can set up the medi-set with the pills in it, and whether or not the care receiver must take them out of the medi-set on their own.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiring-home-help/,Hiring In-Home Help,(See FCA fact sheet Background Checking: Resources That Help),[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiring-home-help/,Hiring In-Home Help,"Once you have identified the types of help you need, write a job description. (See FCA fact sheet Personal Care Agreements.) In addition to including the tasks you have identified, also be specific about:
Training desired: CNA (certified nursing assistant), LVN (licensed vocational nurse), HHA (home health aide)
Driving: Do you want help transporting care receiver? Their car or yours? Reimbursement for mileage? Check with the DMV to confirm their driving record.
Transferring skills: Getting someone out of bed, chair, using Hoyer lift
Experience with people with memory or other cognitive impairments
Language skills: Especially for people who are hard of hearing, or whose primary language is not English.
Housekeeping: What sort of housekeeping do you want in addition to care for the care receiver? Cooking? If so, what kind of foods? Can the attendant accommodate a special diet?
Pets: What kind of care do they require, and what do you expect the attendant to do?
Smoking: Does the care receiver smoke? Does the attendant smoke? If so, is this ok? Where is smoking permitted?
Hours: What times/days are you hiring for?
If hiring privately, also consider:
Wages: Hourly or shift payment? Holiday, vacation, or sick pay (most states now require three paid sick days/year)? How will the attendant be paid, including withholding and taxes (Social Security, Medicare, disability, unemployment)? Cash or check? Weekly, semi-monthly, monthly? Employee or contract worker (W-2 or 1099)? For a fee, an accountant or household employee payroll service provider can assume this responsibility.
Are you providing food for meals, or does the attendant bring their own food?",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiring-home-help/,Hiring In-Home Help,"If you are hiring through an agency, you can shorten this process. If you need help right away, always go through an agency, as hiring privately takes time and energy to secure the right person or team of people. Often an agency representative will come to the house and interview you to find out what type of help you are seeking and will try to match you with the person in their employee pool who best meets your needs. However, having your job description will still be helpful in working with the agency.
Initial interview/screening can be done by phone. Ask for a resume and references. With those who seem like they would be right for your situation, you can set up an in-person interview either at your loved one’s home or at a nearby coffee shop if you prefer. If appropriate, the care receiver should be present at the interview, as their input is important. Other family members or concerned individuals may also be present. Their input can help you make a good decision. The job description can be emailed to the applicant as a way to start the conversation.
Here are some initial questions for the interview:
Why are you interested in this position?
Tell me a little about yourself.
Where have you worked before?
What were your duties? Here is the job description for this position.
What is your favorite kind of client? What pushes your buttons?
Is there anything in the job description that you are uncomfortable doing?
How do you deal with someone living with memory problems? Give an example.
Describe your experience making meals for other people.
How do you handle people who are angry, stubborn and/or fearful?
Do you have a car? Would you prefer to drive your own car or our car in transporting? I’ll need to see proof of insurance and a current driver’s license.
What is your experience transferring someone out of bed or chair and into a wheelchair?
What is your availability? Days? Hours?
Can you give me two work-related and one personal reference I can contact?
I’ll need personal identification that verifies that you can work in this country. Please bring it with you so that I can make a copy.
If the care receiver is present, watch the interactions between the attendant and the care receiver. Do they only respond to you, or do they include the care receiver in their answers? If the care receiver is not present, you might want to invite a top candidate back to meet the care receiver before making a final job offer.
Immediately after the interview, write down your impressions. Include input from the care receiver, if they were present, as well any other family/friends who were a part of the interview. Check your gut. How you feel about someone can go a long way in your finding the right person. Check the references. Have a list of questions to ask about their experience in working with this attendant.
If someone is looking for work, they are probably interviewing with others. Do not wait too long to make a job offer, as the person may have taken a different job. Arrange to meet to sign the contract and establish a start date.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiring-home-help/,Hiring In-Home Help,"If hiring privately, you will need to develop a contract. Use the job description as the basis of the contract. Alternatively, contact an attorney to help draft a simple agreement. The contract formalizes the agreement between you, the employer, and the attendant, the employee. It is signed by both of you. If problems should arise, either party can refer back to the written agreement to help negotiate solutions. In addition to the job description, the contract should have the following:
Your name: The employer
Attendant’s name: The employee
— address, phone number, Social Security number
Wages: (see job description)
— Also include criteria for reimbursement, e.g. is there a petty cash fund for incidentals that the attendant buys?
— If using their own car, will the attendant be paid mileage?
— Get a copy of driver’s license and car insurance
What kind of paperwork do you want the attendant to keep?
— Daily log?
— Medication administration list?
Expectations for behavior: Use of phone, smoking, being late
Grounds for termination: Notice with cause/notice without cause
Date and sign the contract: You and the attendant",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiring-home-help/,Hiring In-Home Help,"Significant legal and financial considerations exist for employers. (See also Resources at the end of this fact sheet.) Check your renter’s or homeowner’s insurance to see that it covers household employees. Be informed about your tax responsibilities if you have a hired employee. All U.S. employees must complete an Employment Eligibility Verification form I-9. This form verifies that the person is legally entitled to work in the United States. A W-4 form is also completed by the employee to set up payroll. You will also have to apply for an employer ID number.
Local services are often available to seniors who need assistance in filing tax statements for household employees, as well as help with doing the payroll. Check with your local Area Agency on Aging to find out what is available in in your area.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiring-home-help/,Hiring In-Home Help,"Your relationship with the attendant, the care receiver’s relationship with the attendant, the attendant’s relationship with you, and the attendant’s relationship with the care receiver are all very important. Good communication is essential for a good relationship. Schedule regular times to meet and discuss concerns, problems, and/or changes. Changes in care needs are to be expected. If there are added responsibilities or changes in who is living in the house, for example, these need to be discussed with the attendant. It is important to make expectations clear and to provide adequate training to meet those expectations. If there are problems, write out what is not working and come together on solutions that both of you sign. Keep communication current; address problems as soon as they arise. If you hire an attendant privately, it is important you feel comfortable both providing training and firing the worker if necessary. The higher the trust, the better the relationship. Trust comes through honest and open communication. If the attendant is doing a great job, be sure to tell them. A smile and well-deserved praise can make a big difference. None of us likes to feel our work is not appreciated. When you find the right person for your caregiving needs, they are worth their weight in gold.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorder-hand/,HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND),"Since the start of the AIDS epidemic more than three decades ago, doctors, family and friend caregivers, and patients have observed that some people with the disease experience decline in brain function and movement skills, as well as shifts in behavior and mood. This disorder is called HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder, or “HAND.” Although advances in antiretroviral therapy from the past two decades have decreased the severity of HAND, symptoms still persist in 30–50% of people living with HIV. For many people, these symptoms continue to affect activities of daily living.
The most severe form of HAND, called HIV-associated Dementia (HAD), now occurs in less than 5% of people who have access to antiretroviral therapy. The more common form of HAND is Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (MND). Symptoms of MND include behavioral changes; difficulty in making decisions; and learning, attention, concentration, and memory difficulties. Some patients develop tremors or loss of coordination. A third form of HAND has been described in research studies: Asymptomatic Neurocognitive Impairment (ANI). Study participants with ANI have impaired performance on neuropsychological tests yet don’t recognize having any symptoms. Early studies suggest that these participants do poorly on tests that evaluate their daily function, suggesting they have real impairment that goes unrecognized. Others note that participants with ANI are more likely to develop symptomatic impairment (e.g. MND) than are participants who test normally on cognitive tests. The following figure summarizes the breakdown of HAND and its various forms.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorder-hand/,HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND),"Risk factors for developing HAND are less clear for people who are taking and adhering to antiretroviral therapy and who have undetectable amounts of HIV in their body fluid (also known as “viral load.”) For those who are not taking these medications, treatment is recommended. It is especially important that patients with detectable viral loads seek care and adhere to medications to achieve an undetectable viral load. Both age and other illnesses appear to increase risk. In untreated patients, a low CD4 count remains a risk factor. CD4 cells or T-helper cells are a type of white blood cell that fights infection.
There is no “typical” course of the ailment. Several groups have described daily fluctuation in abilities. Most of the time, HAND remains relatively mild in patients with suppressed viral load. HAND may be severe or progress rapidly. Some people experience only cognitive disturbances or mood shifts, while others struggle with a combination of mental, motor, and behavior changes. How much these changes disrupt a person’s day-to-day life differs from one individual to the next and from one stage of the disease to another.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorder-hand/,HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND),"Managing HAND is sometimes difficult because side effects from medications, other HIV infections, nutritional imbalances, depression, and anxiety, as well as the effects of comorbid diseases (e.g. vascular disease and liver impairment) can all contribute to cognitive, behavioral, and mood disturbances.
Because neurological changes often develop gradually, it can be a challenge to determine exactly when isolated incidents or symptoms should be given a diagnosis of HAND. In the era of HIV where most people are on treatment, it is becoming clearer that cognitive impairment is often due to more than one cause.
Before the arrival of combination anti-retroviral therapy (also known as cART and sometimes referred to as HAART) in the second half of the 1990s, dementia, the most severe form of HAND, was a frequent finding in late-stage disease. More recently, experts have estimated that less than 5 percent of people on cART develop HAND, although many more suffer from mild changes that can affect daily living.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorder-hand/,HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND),"Unlike many of the infections associated with HIV and AIDS, HAND has a wide range of possible symptoms, which can vary greatly from one person to the next. The symptoms of HAND fall into three broad categories:
Cognitive: problems in concentration (difficulty following the thread of a conversation, short attention span, inability to complete routine tasks, trouble finishing a sentence); memory loss (trouble recalling phone numbers, appointments, medication schedules, agreements, or previous conversations); and a generalized slowdown in mental functions (difficulty understanding and responding to questions, loss of sense of humor or wit).
Motor: poor coordination, weakness in legs, difficulty maintaining balance, tendency to drop things, decline in clarity of handwriting, loss of bladder or bowel control.
Behavioral: personality changes (increased irritability, apathy toward loved ones or life in general, loss of initiative, withdrawal from social contact); mood swings (depression, excitability, emotional outbursts); impaired judgment (impulsive decision-making, loss of inhibitions); and, on occasion, symptoms of psychosis (hallucinations, paranoia, disorientation, sudden rages).
Cognitive problems are often—although not always—the first to become apparent to a person with HAND and their family members, friends, caregivers, and health care providers. Motor and behavioral changes, if they occur, frequently become evident in later stages of the syndrome.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorder-hand/,HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND),"Many factors can contribute to the types of symptoms observed with HAND, making diagnosis a complex and challenging task. Depression, other psychiatric disturbances, reactions to medication, and nutritional deficiencies can all lead to similar symptoms. Infections common among people with advanced HIV can also lead to these symptoms, although typically only among those not on cART (e.g. toxoplasmosis, lymphoma, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML], and cryptococcal meningitis).
An accurate diagnosis of HAND, therefore, requires a comprehensive examination that generally includes a mental status test, a brain scan, and sometimes lab tests on the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord), which are obtained through a procedure known as a spinal tap or lumbar puncture. A mental status exam can help identify whether a person is suffering from memory loss, difficulties with concentration and other thinking processes, mood swings, and other symptoms. The best diagnosis requires a third party (e.g. friend, partner, or other family member) to corroborate the behavior/memory changes.
Because no single test definitively answers the question of whether someone has HAND, the final diagnosis is made by weighing all the evidence together. Time and repeated measures are helpful in confirming a diagnosis.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorder-hand/,HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND),"Although there is no cure for HAND, the single most important treatment is adherence to antiretroviral therapy to maintain a suppressed viral load in the blood. The specific medicines that make up the cART regimen appear to be less important than just being on a regimen. In rare cases, doctors may have to consider how well these medicines get into the central nervous system, and studies are currently underway to determine whether some medications may help symptoms better than others. These new findings, however, should not cloud our understanding that suppression of plasma virus to undetectable or unquantifiable levels in blood appears to be most critical.
Knowing the diagnosis is also sometimes therapeutic, as there is stigma and stress related to these symptoms and how they affect daily activities. These can be addressed with proper diagnosis. Knowing that the illness exists may also prompt compensatory approaches and, ultimately, decrease stress and anxiety.
In addition to treating HAND itself, it is important to find ways to treat the secondary symptoms when possible. Anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, and anti-anxiety drugs can help relieve some of the mental distress people with HAND may experience. However, some of these medications may cause complications when taken along with antiretroviral therapy or other drugs; caution is needed in choosing the best approach. Consultation with an HIV-knowledgeable doctor is recommended.
It is also important that patients engage in their own care to prevent factors that can contribute to cognitive symptoms. This includes aggressive treatment of depression, good health care maintenance to address common comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, lipid abnormalities, liver impairment), avoiding non-prescription drugs and excessive alcohol, working with care providers to assure that the medications taken are all required, and exercise. There is growing evidence that physical exercise is important. Optimally, this can be done while engaging in other activities, since social integration and activities may also be helpful. Keeping engaged with enjoyable activites likely translates into benefits.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hiv-associated-neurocognitive-disorder-hand/,HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND),"Caring for someone with HAND can be stressful. Part of the difficulty is that caregivers must cope with not just the practical implications of the situation—for example making sure the person remembers to take medications on time—but also with the loved one’s own fears and despair about the deterioration of his or her abilities. Exhaustion, fear, isolation, and grief of the loss of the relationship and partnership that once was, are common for caregivers. The fact that HAND can impact behavior (e.g. apathy, depression) and that many people suffer from HAND but don’t feel they have symptoms, makes caregiving even more challenging.
Encouraging someone to obtain a proper diagnosis is an important first step. Because the loss of control can be terrifying, however, some individuals with HAND may be unwilling to admit they are suffering from cognitive loss. Caregivers should be prepared for possible resistance to seeking help. It is important to remind the patient as gently as possible that there may be ways of addressing and improving the situation once the diagnosis is clarified.
This is also the time to make sure that all important legal documents (visit www.caregiver.org/where-find-my-important-papers), such as advance directives, financial durable powers of attorney, POLST (physician orders for life sustaining treatment) forms, and estate plans have been prepared with the help of a knowledgeable attorney for both the patient and their care partner.
Just as in the early stages of Alzheimer’s or other cognitive disorders, there are steps a caregiver can take to make the situation as manageable as possible. In addition to getting informed about HAND, the available treatments, and working with a competent care team, there are steps one can take in their daily life to maximize function and decrease stress.
One of the primary coping strategies is to keep the home environment familiar. Memory prompts, such as calendars, lists, beepers, and pill boxes, can be helpful in alleviating frustration for both the caregiver and the person living with the condition. Matching the ability of the person to the prompt tools used is key to successful use of these aids. For some patients with more severe impairment or dementia, consider simplifying communication by gaining eye contact before you speak, repeating the names of visitors, and talking slowly and clearly while retaining an adult tone of voice and level of respect. It is often helpful to limit the number of tasks that need to be done at the same time and break down directions into one- or two-step commands.
For caregivers themselves, the demands of coping with a person suffering from cognitive loss—whether related to AIDS or another disorder—can be challenging. Feelings of isolation, depression, guilt, rage, despair, and fear are common. It can be crucial for caregivers to seek help themselves, whether in the form of individual counseling or support groups with others in similar circumstances.
Caregivers must build time in the week to take breaks and recharge. Hiring outside assistance, such as a home health aide, to help care for an individual with HAND (particularly individuals with the advanced form, dementia) can be essential to achieving a degree of balance in life. In addition, social service agencies can provide caregiver consultations, respite for caregivers (a break from care), daycare programs, and other practical support services. Some caregivers feel ashamed that they cannot do everything and are reluctant to access such support, especially if the one who is ill resists. But getting the support you need in order to maintain your ability to carry on with caregiving responsibilities and stay healthy while doing so—even over possible objections—can be a genuine expression of love and concern.",dementia

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/holding-family-meeting/,Holding a Family Meeting,"When taking care of an elderly parent or another relative, family members need to work cooperatively. The more people participating in care, the less alone a caregiver feels in his/her role. Books and articles about caregiving often mention the family meeting as a way to facilitate this process. But how does one go about having such a meeting? ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/holding-family-meeting/,Holding a Family Meeting,"Each family is different. In some families, only a husband/wife and their children are considered “family.” In other families, aunts, uncles, cousins, current and ex-in laws, and close friends may be included in the definition of family. When planning a family meeting, it is important to include everyone who is or will be part of the caregiving team, and this may include a family friend, neighbor, or paid caregiver.
It is also sometimes helpful to engage the help of an outside facilitator, such as a social worker or minister, to help the family communicate about difficult subjects during the meeting. (This is discussed in more detail below.)
A decision must also be made about whether or not to include the ill family member in the meeting. Family members usually do not want to be excluded from family events, and their preferences for care must be considered. However, if someone has dementia or another condition where he/she might misunderstand the purpose of the meeting, it might be appropriate to hold at least the first meeting without him/her present. Also, other family members may need to share with each other thoughts or feelings that would be painful for the ill person to hear. Consider holding one meeting to focus on those matters, and holding a second meeting with the ill person present.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/holding-family-meeting/,Holding a Family Meeting,"Communication is the key to working successfully with a group of people. If it’s difficult for some family members to travel to the location of the meeting, technology can help: a conference call or the use of a speaker phone can make it easier for them to participate. A videotape or an audiotape of the meeting can also be sent out to all family members who are unable to attend. With the use of email, even those who are not nearby can also be kept up to date on how things are going.
Prior to a meeting, you’ll find it helpful to prepare an agenda. Someone in the family will generally introduce the idea of a meeting and arrange the date and location. That person can also create an agenda for the meeting and send it out to all the family members ahead of time. Family members can then share their ideas and suggest other items to include.
An agenda might include topics such as:
The latest report from the physician 
Sharing of feelings about the illness/caregiving
Fears:
About death and dying 
About being overwhelmed 
About what will happen to family members after the death 
Sadness, confusion, anger, guilt, shame 
What does the person who is ill want and need? 
Daily caregiving needs:
Should the sick person move in with us? 
Does she/he need to be in an assisted living facility or nursing home? 
How much time does each family member have to visit?

It will probably be difficult to cover all these issues in one meeting, so additional meetings will be helpful. Each ensuing meeting should have a clear timetable and a definite beginning and ending time. Be sure to stick to the time table; if meetings get to be too long, fatigue sets in, minds will wander, and people may resist coming to future meetings.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/holding-family-meeting/,Holding a Family Meeting,"As with all high-level negotiations, deciding where to hold the meeting is as potentially controversial as the meeting itself. Whether you hold it in an office, a restaurant, or someone’s home, keep in mind that you want a setting that the majority of the participants will find comfortable and convenient and that presents as few distractions as possible (e.g. noise, small children who need attention, etc.).
A successful family meeting gives everyone a chance to be heard. All feelings are appropriate and need to be expressed and acknowledged. People will be more willing to talk about their feelings regarding the situation if they feel safe. For example, the brother who is never present may reveal that he is unable to stand seeing someone sick, and the sister who is doing all the work may not realize how she pushes others away when they offer to help. Another sibling may be having marital problems that he or she has not yet shared with the family, and yet another sibling might be worried about losing a job. Each person needs to balance his/her own fears, concern, love, and desire to help with available time, strengths, weaknesses, and hopes.
Until the depth and breadth of the issues concerning the ill family member are explored, it is important to not try to solve the problems. Recording the problems in a list as they are shared, however, will be useful during the problem-solving portion of the meeting.
It is important for each family member to learn to use “I” messages, as well to say “I need…” rather than “You should…” Even when disagreeing, try to find the part of what is said that you can agree with. The goal of the meeting is to work as a team in caring for the person who is ill, even if there is conflict among family members in other areas.
At the conclusion of the meeting, make sure everyone has a clear understanding of the issues and considerations discussed. When the solutions to issues have been established, make sure that each person understands what he/she has agreed to do.
The most important thing for family members to remember is that the meeting is not a one-time event. Family meetings need to take place regularly. It is helpful to schedule them at a given time, perhaps at the same time each month. However, if this is not possible, they at least need to take place when the caregiving situation or other situations in family members’ lives change. Holding regular meetings puts less pressure on family members to get everything resolved in just one meeting, and allows more time for processing of information and decision-making. When a family member is unable to attend a meeting, keep in touch with them by phone, mail, or email.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/holding-family-meeting/,Holding a Family Meeting,"Families come with history: a history of how each person relates to the others, a history of what role each person has played and currently plays within the family, a history of how each person feels toward the person who is sick, and a history of how each person deals with illness and adversity. And in each family there are rules about what can and cannot be said, what emotions are okay and not okay to express. These factors can make family meetings difficult. This is why a third party facilitator can be helpful.
Family members play roles based on position in the family, relationship to the person who is ill, special talents, etc. The person who is the caregiver may be different from the one who handles the money, who may be different from the person who is the information gatherer, who is different from the one who is the decision maker or the one who has some medical background. One person might play several roles. Also, often someone is the “blamer,” and someone else the “blamed.” One person may try to make peace, and another may try to sabotage the process. There will be secrets, old family rivalries, guilt, unequal burdens, differing investments, values, and interests. Some will worry about past promises and about someone else not pulling his/her own weight. Everyone will need attention, power, love, control, and appreciation. It can help to acknowledge that there is probably no fair distribution of work and trying to make it even will fail.
A narrow focus for each meeting can help alleviate some of the pitfalls. Still, you will have to deal with some of the difficult issues when they get in the way of cooperation. Remember that you can’t resolve long-standing family issues with one such meeting. The task is not to “fix” the family, but rather to have everyone on the same team, as much as possible, in caring for someone who is ill.
If alcohol will detract from the main focus of the meeting or will lead to conflict, it is better not to offer it. However, each family has different ways of communicating, and in some families a drink may make everyone more comfortable and more able to talk. In any case, overconsumption should be avoided.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/holding-family-meeting/,Holding a Family Meeting,"Consensus: Not all the issues inherent in caregiving and decision-making can be solved; sometimes it is important to accept approximations of a good solution. Try to work toward consensus building. Change happens slowly, but when families meet regularly, the seeds that are planted can grow into more productive solutions. Often things do not change until there is a crisis, but the work that has been done during the family meeting will make decision-making easier when the crisis does come. Agreements can be made on a time-limited basis to see if the agreed-upon action will work. Future meetings can be used to evaluate these trials and revise them as necessary.
Respecting each person’s individuality and situation helps to create an atmosphere of acceptance and allows for creative solutions to problems. For example, Carol finds it difficult to be around sick people, so when her brother got lung cancer, she knew she couldn’t take care of him. However, she was more than willing to make the pastas of their native Italy and take them to him to comfort him during his illness. Jesse lives a thousand miles away, but can get time off from work to be with her mother while her brother and his family take a vacation. When Ed’s mother had surgery, Ed arranged to take care of his father with Alzheimer’s, while his sister worked full time and helped with the expenses. Gina takes her parents to medical appointments while her sister makes sure they get their medicines properly every night.
Compromise: In order for these solutions to work, people have to learn to compromise. By being open to alternatives, you might get part—although maybe not all—of what you want or need. We often hold out for only one solution to a problem, we don’t consider other possibilities that could assist us. Asking for help is one of the hardest things to do. Learning to graciously receive help offered can also be a struggle, not only for the person who is sick, but also for the person who is the primary caregiver. Being appreciative is the best reward you can give someone who is trying to help you, even if the type of help he/she is offering isn’t exactly what you wanted. When you make someone feel good about helping, he/she will want to help again. “Thank you” will take you a long way in working together. In creating the caregiving team, think about how each person should be acknowledged.
Put it in writing: A written agreement capturing the decisions and agreements made at the end of the meeting can be a helpful reminder for family members. Distributing a calendar with different days marked with responsibilities and commitments can also help each person honor the agreements made.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/holding-family-meeting/,Holding a Family Meeting,"Although family meetings can be powerful and effective ways to connect and work with family members, they cannot magically solve all the problems of caring for an ill family member. When families have trouble working together or coming to agreements or when the family is divided on a big issue, it often helps to invite a neutral outside facilitator to attend. Sometimes a crisis precipitates the need for a meeting—perhaps someone is in the hospital and major life and death decisions need to be made. Time can be of the essence. Whatever work you have done together earlier will help you at these times of extreme stress.
Social workers from local caregiver organizations (such as Caregiver Resource Centers in California), as well as ministers, private case managers, social workers in home health or hospice, physicians, and discharge planners in hospitals and nursing homes can help facilitate a family meeting or refer you to someone who can. Psychotherapists in private practice are trained in family counseling. If you find yourself in a difficult position, you might also want to see a psychotherapist privately. Don’t forget the support you can find with friends, colleagues, and support groups. Sharing experiences with other caregivers can help ease the feelings and frustrations often involved in being a caregiver.",[]

Family meetings with your parent, spouse, children, siblings and other key people will help everyone share their views and will help you decide how best to proceed. Active communication among all family members is the building block to a strong support system for an older parent and all family members involved.
Although some of these discussions may be very difficult and emotional, several topics require attention. Together, the family—including your parent—will need to talk about:
all possible residential options
the type of care needed
finances
each person’s role in the transition
changes in lifestyle
the location of the new home
Expectations must be defined and clear to everyone involved. The following can help guide your discussions.",[]

It’s essential to develop a strategy for providing care, and this requires both practicality and planning. Consulting with a Geriatric Care Manager or social worker may be beneficial as you consider your options and what you will and will not be able to do for your parent.
Evaluate whether your parent needs constant supervision or assistance throughout the day and how this might be provided.
Determine which activities of daily living (such as eating, bathing, toileting) your parent can do independently.
Determine your comfort level for providing personal care such as bathing or changing an adult incontinence pad.
Evaluate your own health and physical abilities to help decide if you are able to provide care for your parent.
Explore the availability of services such as in-home care, adult day services, meal delivery, a friendly visitor program,
Investigate long-term arrangements and options if living with your parent will not work or is not your choice.
Determine the type of medical care that will be needed by your parent, and whether appropriate physicians and services—including transportation services—are available in your community.

Be realistic about the significant life changes that relocating your parent will mean for you, your parent, your siblings, your spouse and children.

When deciding whether to relocate or move your parent into your home, consider the opinions of your spouse, children, siblings and other family members.
Come to an agreement with your siblings regarding how much and what kind of help you can expect to receive from them.
Recognize that, despite possible cognitive or physical limitations, that your parent is an adult, is entitled to maintain as much autonomy and dignity as possible, and should be at the center of any decision-making.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/home-away-home-relocating-your-parents/,Home Away from Home: Relocating Your Parents,"Moving your parent into your home is certainly one option, but you and your family should take some time to consider other living arrangements as well. The type of housing you choose will largely depend on three important factors: your parent’s care needs, finances, and the service and supportive options available in your parent’s or your community.
When deciding where a parent should live, family members need to discuss, understand and accept the benefits and drawbacks of living close to one relative versus another. Often, the choice of location can cause conflict between family members because those living near the parent often bear most of the responsibility for the parent’s care, and may feel that those living further away do not help enough. On the other hand, family members who live far away can feel frustrated that they do not have the opportunity to participate more in providing care. An open dialogue and an agreement on how to share local and long-distance caregiving are essential.
Many residential communities for seniors are owned and operated by faith-based or other organizations with which your parent may feel an affiliation or interest. Ask your parent if they know of any friends who have moved to these new communities, and find out if your parent would be interested in being in the same community. Before any decision is made, visit more than one community with your parent, ask to join the community for lunch and get a facility tour, view the activities schedule and menu, and take particular note of how the staff interacts with the residents. Ask the community employees how they might accommodate your parent’s interests, hobbies and transportation needs. If the community under consideration is a category of licensed facility, ask to view the facility’s compliance history with minimum standards, and the number and types of complaints that may have been filed against the facility.
The following list outlines different types of living arrangements that may be appropriate for your parent. Each community offers different choices. Remember, Medicare does not usually cover these expenses.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/home-away-home-relocating-your-parents/,Home Away from Home: Relocating Your Parents,"Living Independently: Most people prefer to remain in their own homes if possible. Sometimes resources in the community such as meal delivery service, “friendly visitors,” housekeeping, transportation or other in-home assistance provide enough support so your parent can remain at home, in familiar surroundings. Keep in mind, though, that it can be a hard sell for your parent to accept this kind of help if he or she feels you are meddling and the assistance is unneeded. These issues must be addressed in a family meeting. A small apartment, condominium or one-story house in their community or close to you might also be feasible, with help and check-ins from family. Sharing an apartment or house with a friend or relative could be another possibility. There are agencies in some cities that help arrange shared living situations. A newer option, called Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) or Villages, offers members—generally a group of older people whose homes are in close proximity—vetted services such as home repair, transportation and social/educational activities. There is a fee to join and the organization is directed by volunteers and/or paid staff. This is a growing movement across the country, and for some people, this is enough support to allow them to remain in their homes.
 Retirement Community: Independent retirement communities usually offer individual apartments in a multi-unit setting, with group meals, transportation, housekeeping services and numerous organized social and enrichment activities. Residents are free to come and go as they please and still retain their privacy, yet have the benefits of a larger group setting. Amenities and prices vary from place to place. Some offer access to a nurse or nurse practitioner. As care needs increase, additional services (e.g., help with dressing) often can be added for a fee. Some communities require that new residents be ambulatory (not in a wheelchair) at admission. Some places offer subsidized housing for low-income individuals, with stringent limitations.
 Residential Care Facility (RCF): These facilities are small group homes (sometimes called board and care homes or adult foster home) that provide supervision, meals and care for people who cannot be left alone but do not require skilled nursing care. Residential care facilities provide assistance with bathing, grooming, eating, using the toilet, and walking, and they also provide socialization and recreational activities. Rooms may be private or shared.
 Assisted Living Facility (ALF): Individuals who are somewhat independent but require daily oversight and assistance with housekeeping, medication management and personal care will want to consider an assisted living facility. Assisted living facilities offer rooms or apartment-style accommodations and, often, social activities. Meals are provided in a shared dining room. Staff is available to assist with care needs such as bathing, grooming, eating or using the toilet, and care is arranged as needed by the individual. Medical staff may be on-site or on call. The monthly charge for assisted living is determined by how much care a person requires and varies widely throughout the US. Some assisted living facilities are dedicated to—or include a separate wing for—those with Alzheimer’s disease or other memory impairments. These “dementia care” or “memory care” units offer a special security-protected environment, and social and other activities designed for the abilities of the residents.
 Intermediate Care Facility (ICF): This type of facility provides ’round-the-clock care for those who require help with bathing, grooming, going to the toilet and walking. Individuals in these facilities cannot live independently and require nursing care, although the nursing care is not offered 24 hours a day. Residents generally require a lower level of care than is offered in skilled nursing facilities.
 Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF): Commonly called nursing homes, these facilities provide nursing services 24 hours a day and are designed to provide high levels of personal and medical care, such as administration of injections, monitoring of blood pressure, managing ventilators and intravenous feedings to individuals who cannot function independently. People living in skilled nursing facilities usually require help with the majority of their self-care needs; it would be very difficult to provide this level of care in a home environment. Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California) may help cover the costs if residents meet specific financial and medical requirements. Medicare may pay for a time-limited stay after hospital discharge, on a doctor’s orders.
 The Eden (or Greenhouse) Alternative is a program in certain nursing facilities around the country to make the environment more elder-centered and less institutional. These are set up to encourage as much independence and interaction as possible for the residents, and to be more home-like. Contact with plants, animals and children is encouraged.
 The Program for All Inclusive Care (PACE) is designed for people 55 years or older certified by the state where they reside to be nursing-home-eligible, but who can remain at home with a complement of health and supportive services. Sometimes referred to as a “nursing home without walls” this growing care option is available in many, but not all, parts of the country. Most participants are Medicaid-eligible.
 Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) (sometimes called “Life Care”) offer independent, assisted and skilled nursing facilities all in one location. If a person’s health deteriorates, a disruptive move to a new community is not necessary. These communities often can be quite large and generally require a substantial entrance fee.
 Veteran’s Communities may be available in your state, and offer multiple levels of care. From independent living with supportive health and social services, to skilled nursing facilities, these communities permit a veteran (or their spouse) to live in the same community.
Regardless of the type of facility you choose, be sure to visit each one. Don’t be shy about asking a lot of questions. A preliminary visit should reveal a facility that is clean, smells pleasant, has staff actively but gently interacting with residents, and in which the residents are satisfied with their “home.”",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/home-away-home-relocating-your-parents/,Home Away from Home: Relocating Your Parents,"Change of Family Roles. If you and your parent decide the best place for your parent is in your home, understand that living with a parent most likely will lead to a shift in family roles. A once-authoritative parent may become more dependent—you may become the guardian who gives direction and controls many aspects of your parent’s life, while trying to preserve as much autonomy as possible for your parent. You may have less time for your spouse and for yourself. You may need your children to help with more household responsibilities including care of their grandparent. These role changes can be hard adjustments for everyone.
Determine your ease with becoming the decision-maker and the person with authority.
Be prepared for resistance from your parent if they feel that they can no longer set the rules, control their situation or fear losing independence, but make sure your parent is involved in the decision-making process and that their perspectives and preferences are heard.
When possible, allow for negotiation in decision-making activities offering a greater chance for a win-win situation.
Consider how your parent can contribute to the household, such as babysitting, doing light chores or making financial contributions.
Think about your spouse’s and children’s readiness to help with caregiving, and their comfort level with having a grandparent in the home—particularly if he or she suffers from dementia.
Think about ways in which your parent’s traditional interests, routines and food preferences can be accommodated, without unnecessarily disrupting your own lives.
Agree upon financial arrangements up front. Given available resources, will your parent be able to contribute towards food and utilities?
If you have siblings or other family members with whom your parent is comfortable, can you agree in advance that they can stay with your parent, or accommodate your parent temporarily in their home so you are able to get a break from caregiving or take a vacation?
Lifestyle Changes. You and your parent probably have very different lifestyles. Sleeping cycles, eating patterns and preferences, social calendars, interests, and daily activities may need adjustments in order to guarantee a smooth transition.
Talk about and plan how to accommodate bedtimes, nap schedules and sleeping habits of all family members in the house.
Discuss what types of food you eat, when meals are prepared, and if special diets are required and how they will be accommodated.
Assess whether smoking/nonsmoking or drinking/nondrinking practices are compatible.
Consider how you can support your parent’s continued participation in social networks such as visiting friends and attending a place of worship and how transportation to these and other activities will be managed.
Encourage your parent to keep enjoyable and safe hobbies.
Consider whether your parent will be fully integrated into your family’s activities or whether he/she will maintain an independent social life.
Consider how the household noise level and general activity pattern will affect your parent.
The Loss of Your Time. Caregiving requires a significant amount of time and is very likely to impact your work, family time, personal time and sleep.
Determine the amount of time you can devote to your parent’s care needs. When will you make phone calls for appointments or to set up needed services? When will you be able to take your parent to medical appointments?
Evaluate whether you will need to make adjustments to your current work schedule and if your employer is willing to accommodate those adjustments.
If you will reduce your work hours, determine the implications for your financial picture, career advancement, health insurance and Social Security and retirement benefits.
Consider whether you will have time for your spouse, children and friends.
If your parent requires full-time supervision, who will provide it while you are at work or attending your children’s activities?
Consider the reduced private time you will have to pursue your own friendships, hobbies or exercise, and your need for some time alone on a daily basis.
Expect that you will, at times, feel your energy is spent and will need to find a way to rest.
Investigate how to arrange for some time off from caregiving duties (“respite”) and enlist the help of your family members, friends, a paid aide or a home care agency.
Your Home. Physical living arrangements must be adequate if your parent is to move in. There must be enough room and a layout that is adaptable to an older adult who may have mobility or vision problems. A home may require special adaptations to make it safe. Many of these changes are inexpensive but need time and planning to implement. Some families consider an addition to their home or the use of an “accessory apartment” (or “accessory dwelling unit”)—a fully equipped modular unit that may be temporarily or permanently set up in the yard or elsewhere on a lot. Home health agencies and/or area agencies on aging may have the resources to do a home assessment in terms of home modifications, and safe lift/transfer techniques that are recommended to better assist your parent.
Evaluate the amount of available space and whether there is enough privacy.
Think about where your parent will sleep. How will a child feel if he or she has to give up a room for a grandparent?
If possible, locate your parent on the first floor in order to avoid stairs.
Consider major changes that may be needed in order to accommodate any disabilities or mobility problems, for example wheelchair-accessible bathroom and shower, different door handles, lower light switches.
Determine what assistive devices may be needed such as grab bars in the bathroom, raised toilet seats, handrails and a ramp.
If your parent wanders and is at risk for becoming lost, consider special locks, door chimes and other devices that will help keep doors and windows safely secured.
Look through your home for hazards such as dangling cords, toxins, slippery surfaces, unsteady chairs, throw rugs. Consider installing a stove-top shut-off device.
Install bright non-glare lights above all walkways, and low-cost adhesive strips on steps and other potentially slippery areas such as bathrooms and showers.
Adjust temperature controls so that the house is not too hot or too cold. Be aware that older people often like their environment warmer and this may affect both your comfort and your utility bills.
Discuss how you might incorporate your parent’s furniture into your home.
Review how existing or new pets will be integrated into the new home situation.
Think about having a system or alarm set up so you can be alerted when your parent needs help.",[]

However, if you are caring for a parent it may become necessary for you to become more involved in his/her personal finances, including paying bills, monitoring accounts and managing retirement accounts or investments. This can create problems with your parent or siblings who may question your access to and how you are handling your parent’s money.
Agree upon how much, if any, financial payment your parent will provide towards their living expenses. Will they pay for rent, food and other costs?
Your siblings may be resentful of any money you might receive. Openly discuss financial arrangements with siblings to keep them updated on new expenditures and apprised of accounts.
Come to an agreement between your parent and siblings regarding out-of-pocket expenses.
Consider a preparing a formal legal document called a Personal Care Agreement describing any payment to you from your parent for accommodations or your caregiving services.
To save time, investigate the option of automatic payment of recurring bills.
Look into free or low-cost services that assist with Medicare paperwork for older adults.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/home-away-home-relocating-your-parents/,Home Away from Home: Relocating Your Parents,"It is likely that your parent has lived in his or her current home for many years and has developed strong ties to community, family, friends, healthcare providers, social life and daily routine. Packing and moving out of a house is a significant chore for anybody, but for the older adult who has decades’ worth of memories and possessions, moving can represent a tremendous emotional challenge. Moving away from this familiar and comfortable setting is difficult and can cause great sadness. Furthermore, leaving one’s own house represents a decrease in independence and signals a new life stage. Often the thought of packing and sorting decades of history, memories and possessions is daunting enough to delay even considering the difficult decision to relocate. But there are some resources to help.
In some communities, there are specialized companies that will, for a fee, help organize a senior’s move to a new location and arrange to sell or give away unneeded furniture and possessions. They will also help pack and unpack. Regardless of services used, in most families the adult children still play key roles in this task. Open communication will help ease the way through these challenges.
While you help your parent pack, talk through the difficult feelings, acknowledge the loss that your parent is experiencing and reassure him/her that you are all making the best decision possible. Allow time and opportunity to reminisce. Reassure your parent that you will still be involved in their life regardless of their living arrangements—even in a new community you will want to ensure that the quality of care are services meet your parent’s needs.
If your parent owns the home, consider renting it to tenants. The rental income can help defray extra costs that the family may incur, or help pay for the care provided in other community settings, and offer certain tax benefits. In addition, renting the home, rather than selling, can also give your parent a longer transitional period to adjust to new living arrangements. Selling a long-time residence can seem very final, and can add an extra dimension of anxiety to the transition.
Your parent will need time to adjust to his/her new living environment and role with your family. Your patience and support will help make this transition smoother. An outside counselor may also be helpful. For additional advice on moving your parent to a new living situation, see the FCA Fact Sheet Downsizing Your Home: A Checklist for Caregivers.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hospital-discharge-planning-guide-families-and-caregivers/,Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers,"A trip to the hospital can be an intimidating event for patients and their families. As a caregiver, you are focused completely on your family member or friend’s medical care, and so is the hospital staff. You might not be giving much thought to what will happen when your friend or family member leaves the hospital.
Everything about this transition – whether the discharge is to home, a short-term rehabilitation (“rehab”) center, or a residential nursing facility – is critical to the health and well-being of the person you care for. Studies have found that improvements in hospital discharge planning can dramatically improve the outcome for patients as they move to the next level of care.
Patients, family caregivers, and health care providers all are involved in maintaining a patient’s health after discharge. Yet, while it’s a significant part of the overall care plan, there is a surprising lack of consistency in both the quality and process of discharge planning across the health care system.
This fact sheet offers information, tools, and resources to support you and the person you care for during this critical time, including:
Keys to a successful transition from hospital to home or care center
Suggestions for improving the process
Checklists for caregivers to help ensure the best care
Tips to remove barriers and encourage meaningful communication between you, the doctor, and other health care practitioners
But first, let’s cover a few legal topics that will be relevant to you as a caregiver.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hospital-discharge-planning-guide-families-and-caregivers/,Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers,"You may have heard about HIPAA restrictions. HIPAA rules impact the sharing of information about patients in medical care. Although when the act was first initiated there was some confusion about how much information families and caregivers could receive about a patient’s medical situation, it is now clear that information must be shared.
The US Department of Health and Human Services says: If the patient is present and has the capacity to make health care decisions, a health care provider may discuss the patient’s health information with a family member, friend, or other person if the patient agrees or, when given the opportunity, does not object.
A health care provider also may share information with these persons if, using professional judgment, he or she decides that the patient does not object.
In either case, the health care provider may share or discuss only the information that the person involved needs to know about the patient’s care or payment for care. Particularly when you are named in an Advance Directive, there should be no problem with your being able to receive information about, and speak for, your friend or family member. Check to be sure that a current copy of the Advance Directive is in the patient file. Patients can also sign an authorization form that gives health care providers permission to speak with you.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hospital-discharge-planning-guide-families-and-caregivers/,Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers,"These documents clarify who will speak for patients if they cannot speak for themselves.
The documents may be referred to as living wills, health care proxies or Durable Powers of Attorney for Health Care.
These documents can only be completed when a person is competent to do so (if someone has dementia, talk to the doctor about whether they still are competent to sign a legal document).
They include instructions on the type of care individuals desire if they are very ill or dying.
Many doctors’ offices and hospitals have forms available.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hospital-discharge-planning-guide-families-and-caregivers/,Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers,"The CARE Actis in place to ensure hospitals aren’t discharging patients without preparing family caregivers. With the CARE Act, hospitals must do three things:
Record the name of the family caregiver on the medical record of the person being cared for.
Inform the family caregivers when their friend or family member is to be discharged.
Provide the family caregiver with education and instruction for the medical tasks he or she will need to perform for the patient at home.
The CARE Act has been signed into law in the majority of U.S. States as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. AARP (American Association of Retired Persons) championed this act and continues working toward making it a law in every state.
AARP has a helpful printable fact sheet on the CARE Act: https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/ppi/2019/03/the-care-act-implementation-progress-and-promise.pdf. You can also download your free CARE Act wallet card: https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/local/info-2017/care-act-aarp-wallet-card.html?cmp=RDRCT-4e6ca682-20200402. Print one for you and one for the person you care for to keep in your wallets next to insurance cards, so information on the CARE Act is at your fingertips when you need it.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hospital-discharge-planning-guide-families-and-caregivers/,Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers,"You and your friend or family member have the right to have an interpreter present – it’s important that language not be a barrier to clear communication.
If you or the person you care for prefer speaking in a language other than English, be sure to request a professional interpreter. Hospitals and clinicians are legally required to provide that service to you, so if a professional interpreter is unavailable, the health care organization should make arrangements for translation services via video or telephone.
Written materials must be provided in your preferred language as well.
Studies have shown that numerous, often dangerous errors can be made in home care when language is not taken into account at discharge. More than 200 different languages are spoken in the US, with approximately 25 million people speaking English at a level below “very well.” This is further complicated when the discussion includes complex medical information.
Fortunately, based on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, patients have the right to the services of an interpreter—including sign language interpreters—in health care settings. The availability of certified interpreters able to translate medical/health care language still varies widely from state to state, and some families simply use a relative to provide translation. But when complicated medical information is delivered or treatment decisions must be made, that may not be the best choice.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hospital-discharge-planning-guide-families-and-caregivers/,Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers,"If you have concerns about the quality of care a hospital, rehab, or nursing facility provides, you have a right to speak up – while it’s happening as well as after being discharged.
Your first step:  Bring your complaints to the doctor and nurses, if possible. Be specific in your concerns and ask them how they will resolve the issues. Another option is requesting a conversation with a hospital social worker who has experience addressing problems and connecting patients with the right resources. Hospitals usually have a department of Patient Relations, Patient Advocates, or Customer Service; you can also make a complaint or raise your concerns with them.
If the person you care for is covered by Medicare: You can file a complaint about their care with your State’s Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) Here’s a link to a site listing QIOs and the states they cover: https://www.ahqa.org/ahqa-member-organizations/. QIOs act on behalf of Medicare to address care complaints from people covered by Medicare. QIOs typically take care of issues such as getting the wrong medication, having the wrong surgery, or receiving inadequate treatment. You can also find your QIO by calling 1-800-MEDICARE.
If not covered by Medicare: Report your concerns to your state’s department overseeing health care institutions or medical licensing board. You can also make complaints to the Joint Commission, an independent nonprofit that accredits health care organizations. You can also contact your health insurance provider or state department of health insurance if you think the patient is not getting the care they need.
At a rehabilitation or nursing home facility: Contact the ombudsperson. Go to theconsumervoice.org, and click Get Help to find the contact information for your local ombudsman program. That is the recommended first step to addressing quality of care in rehab and residence facilities.
If you think your friend or family member is not medically ready to be discharged: There are steps you can take. We address this concern in detail a bit further into this fact sheet (see the section: What if You Feel It’s Too Early for Discharge?).
You can find more guidance about how to complain and be heard on the website of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality: https://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/patient-involvement/how-to-complain.html.
Now let’s get back to preparing for discharge.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hospital-discharge-planning-guide-families-and-caregivers/,Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers,"According to Medicare, discharge planning is a process that determines the kind of care a patient needs after leaving the hospital. Discharge plans should ensure a patient’s transition from the hospital to another medical facility or to their home is as safe and smooth as possible.
Only a physician can authorize a patientʼs release from the hospital, but the actual process and preparation of discharge planning can be completed by a number of people. Some hospitals have a dedicated discharge planning manager on staff, but your point person could also be a social worker, nurse, or other hospital representative. Ideally, and especially for the complicated medical conditions, discharge planning is done with a team approach.
In general, the basics of a discharge plan are:
Evaluation of the patient by qualified personnel
Discussion with the patient and/or their representative and involving them in the planning
Reconciling medications – a thorough review of prescriptions, plus comparing pre-hospitalization meds with post-discharge meds to be certain there are no duplications, omissions, harmful side effects, or drug interactions.
Planning for homecoming or transfer to another care facility
Determining the need for caregiver training or any other support
Referrals to a home care agency and/or appropriate support organizations in the community
Arranging for follow-up appointments or tests
Who to contact if you need help – ensuring you have the name and email address of your go-to person for care questions, as well as a phone number where you can get help 24 hours a day, including weekends.
The planning discussion will cover everything from the types of care that will be required to equipment needs, from diet and meal planning to medication administration. Even transportation and chores should be covered.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hospital-discharge-planning-guide-families-and-caregivers/,Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers,"The main reason discharge planning is such a priority – not just for hospitals and care teams, but also the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services – is this:
Effective discharge planning can decrease the chances the person you care for is readmitted to the hospital.
A thoughtfully developed plan aids recovery, ensures medications are prescribed, and given correctly, and adequately prepares you to take over your friend or family member’s care – all of which contribute to care that reduces the chance of readmissions.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hospital-discharge-planning-guide-families-and-caregivers/,Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers,"Not all hospitals are successful in this. Although both the American Medical Association and the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO) offer recommendations for discharge planning, there is no universally utilized system in US hospitals.
What we do know is research indicates that excellent planning and good follow-up can:
Improve patient health
reduce readmissions
decrease health care costs.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hospital-discharge-planning-guide-families-and-caregivers/,Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers,"The discharge planner will look to you, the caregiver, for history and insights about your friend or family member. As their advocate, you are likely to play a central role, managing many vital tasks:
collect information
speak to doctors
transport the patient
ensure lab tests are done
pick up, prepare and give medications
research treatment options and risks
handle insurance
As discharge nears, things can feel rushed at the hospital; in that rush, it can be easy to forget what needs to be discussed. If you’re feeling hurried, it is reasonable to ask the discharge planning team to slow things down so nothing is overlooked.
You may want to print out and bring this fact sheet with you to the hospital; if for some reason the discharge planning team doesn’t cover these subjects, you should feel comfortable raising them, yourself.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hospital-discharge-planning-guide-families-and-caregivers/,Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers,"The discharge planners should discuss with you your willingness and ability to provide care. You may have physical, financial, or other limitations that affect your caregiving capabilities. You may have other obligations such as a job or childcare that impact the time you have available. It is extremely important to tell hospital discharge staff about those limitations.
It is essential that you get any training you need in special care techniques. Some of the care your friend or family member needs might be quite complicated. Your discharge planning manager should ensure you know what is required with wound, feeding tube or catheter care, procedures for a ventilator, or transferring someone from bed to chair (and that you know how to get the equipment required for these tasks). Request all instructions and guidance are provided in writing. If the hospital has video resources for specific tasks (wound care, for example), ask them to include links to those in the discharge instructions.
If the person you care for has memory problems caused by Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, or another disorder, discharge planning becomes more complicated. You may need to remind the staff about special care and communication techniques needed by your friend or family member. Even without impaired memory, older people often have hearing or vision problems or are disoriented when they are in the hospital, which means these conversations are difficult to comprehend. They will need your help and patience.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hospital-discharge-planning-guide-families-and-caregivers/,Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers,"Listed below are common care responsibilities you may be handling for your friend or family member after they return home:
Personal care: bathing, eating, dressing, toileting
Household care: cooking, cleaning, laundry, shopping
Health care: medication management, physicianʼs appointments, physical therapy, wound treatment, injections, medical equipment and techniques
Emotional care: companionship, meaningful activities, conversation
There is no single best path for lining up the help you will need. Patients and caregivers turn to many different sources for support.
The community. Community organizations can help with transportation, meals, support groups, counseling, and possibly a break from your care responsibilities to allow you to rest and take care of yourself (also known as respite care). Finding those services can take some time and several phone calls. The discharge planner should be familiar with these community supports, but if not, your local senior center or a private case manager might be helpful. (See the Resources section at the end of this Fact Sheet.) Family and friends also might assist you with home care.
Home health professional services. Hiring in-home help is an option – one that takes time to research options, check references and make decisions that often include family members. Out of necessity, hiring decisions are often made in a hurry at the time of discharge. You might be handed a list of agencies – but even with help, selecting in-home help is not something to be rushed. Start discussions around discharge plans as soon as possible after admission — that will provide you time to research your options while your friend or family member is cared for in the hospital. If medically necessary, the doctor may authorize short term Home Health services when your family member is discharged.
A few notes about in-home help and finding the right fit:
Think about the needs of the person you are caring for as well as your needs as a caregiver – including language and cultural background.
You have a choice between hiring an individual directly or going through a home care or home health care agency. Part of that decision may be affected by whether the help will be “medically necessary” (i.e., prescribed by the doctor), and therefore paid for by Medicare, Medicaid, or other insurance. In that case, they will most likely determine the agency you use.
In making your decisions, consider the pros and cons of your options. Home health care agencies handle paperwork for taxes and salary, ensure substitutes will be available if the worker is sick, and may provide access to a broader range of skills. On the other hand, if you hire an individual directly, there may be a more personal relationship, and the cost is likely to be lower. In either case, try to get recommendations from nurses, social workers, friends and others familiar with your situation.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hospital-discharge-planning-guide-families-and-caregivers/,Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers,"If the patient is being discharged to a rehab facility or nursing home, effective transition planning should do the following:
ensure continuity of care
clarify the current state of the patientʼs health and capabilities
review medications
help you select the facility to which the person you care for is to be released",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hospital-discharge-planning-guide-families-and-caregivers/,Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers,"Too often choosing a facility can be a source of stress for families. You may have very little time and limited information to make your decision. The list of questions included in this fact sheet (below) will give you some direction as you start your search for a facility.
Ask for help. You can hire a private geriatric care manager (for whom you will pay an hourly fee) to help research and recommend facilities based on your friend or family member’s specific needs. A social worker can offer much needed advice and support. Consider the ratings and feedback from credible online reviews of rehab facilities and nursing homes in your area (see the Resources section of this Fact Sheet).
Focus on quality of care. While you need to be able to easily get to the facility, you may have to sacrifice some convenience for the sake of ensuring higher quality care for your friend or family member.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hospital-discharge-planning-guide-families-and-caregivers/,Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers,"Understanding and navigating payment for after-hospital care needs:
You might not be aware that insurance, including Medicare, does not pay for all services after a patient has been discharged from the hospital.
Certain skilled care or equipment, however, may be covered – if it is determined by the doctor to be “medically necessary.”
Gather your questions regarding payment and check directly with knowledgeable sources – the hospital, your insurer, or Medicare – to find out what might be covered and what you will have to pay for. Keep careful records of your conversations.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hospital-discharge-planning-guide-families-and-caregivers/,Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers,"As their advocate, you have the right to appeal a decision to discharge your friend or family member from the hospital if you think it’s too early or if you think discharge to home is not safe.
If you don’t think they are medically ready to leave the hospital, your first step is to talk with the discharge planner (often a social worker) and express your reservations. It is a good idea to put it in writing – email or text. The discharge planner will take your concerns to the doctor who makes this decision.
While still in the hospital and if covered by Medicare or by a Medicare-managed care plan, your friend or family member can file an appeal about a discharge right on the spot. You should get a form from the hospital titled “An Important Message from Medicare,” which explains how to appeal a hospital discharge decision. Note: Appeals are free and generally resolved in 2 to 3 days. The hospital cannot discharge you until the appeal is completed.

You may want to use your phone to record conversations with the discharge planner or doctor to help you remember what was said.
Check out the tools, organizations and websites we recommend under the additional resources section below.
Talk to people – your medical care team, definitely, but other people can point you in the right direction, too. While certain aspects of your situation may be unique, hospitalization and transitions in care are experiences most people are familiar with.

However, for elderly and disabled people and those with chronic health conditions such as vascular disease or diabetes, the weather does not have to hit 100 degrees to cause heat stress or even deadly heat stroke.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hot-weather-tips/,HOT Weather Tips,"As we age, we gradually lose the ability to perspire and regulate our body temperature. This is why older people tend to overdress — they don’t feel heat the same way anymore. Heart rates do not speed up-or return to normal-as fast during exercise. Older skin also thins and offers less protection from the sun. Poor circulation, heart, lung and kidney diseases, and high blood pressure increase the risk for heat-related illness. Being overweight or underweight also increases risk.
Medications taken for a variety of diseases and symptoms can also interfere with one’s ability to manage hotter weather. These medications include antipsychotic drugs commonly given to Alzheimer’s patients to control agitation, anticholinergic drugs, tranquilizers, sedatives (including over-the-counter sleeping pills), amphetamines, diuretics and drugs to control blood pressure, antihistamines, and some antidepressants.
A person with cognitive impairment, whether from disease or injury, may not be able to communicate distress. In some cases, they may not even “feel” the heat or discomfort because of changes in the brain’s abilities to process sensory information or regulate their body’s responses to heat.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hot-weather-tips/,HOT Weather Tips,"Caregivers can prevent a heat-related emergency (hyperthermia) by keeping a loved one cool, watching for signs of heat stress and following these tips for dealing with hot weather.
Wear cool clothing: See that the person is dressed in light-weight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothing, preferably of natural fabrics like cotton. Use hats and umbrellas outside. If the air conditioning appears to bother the person, offer layers, such as a long-sleeved shirt or sweater over the shoulders, or a light cloth over the ankles.
Use air conditioning: Keep the air conditioning on below 80 degrees F. If you don’t have air conditioning, invest in a room air conditioner or use room fans to circulate inside air. If possible, drive the person a short distance to an air-conditioned place where they can sit, such as a library, mall, restaurant or theater. But avoid overcrowded places and rush hours.
Cover windows: During the day, pull the curtains on all windows that are in direct sunlight. Open windows at night and use fans or cross-ventilation to circulate cooler air. (An open, uncovered window during the day will simply make the inside temperature the same as outside.)
Avoid direct sun: Stay indoors during the hottest hours, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Drive as close to the door of destinations as possible, but don’t leave the person in the car where temperatures can soar quickly. If the person wants to be outside, make sure it’s during cooler hours and that he or she is in the shade, on a covered porch, or under an umbrella. Also check the news for information about temperatures, humidity levels and air pollution alerts.
Eliminate or limit physical activity: If the person’s physician approves light exercise such as walking and movement exercises, limit them to short periods during cool hours. Eliminate entirely on very hot days.
Drink plenty of fluids: Give the person plenty of water and fruit or vegetable juice even if they say they’re not thirsty. No alcohol, coffee or tea. Seek medical help if you suspect dehydration.
Light meals: Avoid hot, heavy meals and don’t use the oven.
Monitor medications: Find out if the person’s medications increase his or her risk for heat stress. Be sure to ask a physician about all the medications being taken, including off-the-shelf items.
Take cool showers: Help the person take a cooling shower or bath. Lay a cool, moistened towel over the forehead or back of the neck and replace often.
Check in often: If the person lives alone, check in daily or ask a neighbor to look in several times a day. If the person lacks transportation, make sure someone takes him or her to and from appointments, grocery stores, etc.
Inform others: If the person is in a nursing home or other facility, make sure the facility has a plan for dealing with rising temperatures and is following the tips mentioned above. Visit as often as possible.
Be alert: Remember that a cognitively-impaired person may not be able to tell you when he or she is feeling hot or ill. Also, older people tend to feel colder than younger people so they may not sense the danger of hotter weather.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hot-weather-tips/,HOT Weather Tips,"If you are caring for an elderly or disabled person, learn the signs of heat-related problems. Seek medical assistance for any of the following signs and — if you suspect heat stroke — call 911 or medical personnel immediately.
Headache, nausea and fatigue are signs of at least some heat stress.
Heat fatigue: cool, moist skin, a weakened pulse, feeling faint.
Heat syncope: sudden dizziness, pale, sweaty looking skin that is moist and cool to the touch, weakened pulse and rapid heart rate but normal body temperature (that is, 98.6 degrees, taken with a thermometer).
Heat cramps: muscle spasms in the abdomen, arms or legs after exercise. (Note that these may be caused by lack of salt but do not give salt or salt tablets without consulting a physician.)
Heat exhaustion: this is warning that the body is getting too hot. Watch for thirst, giddiness, weakness, lack of coordination, nausea, and profuse sweating. Cold, clammy skin. Body temperature may be normal (98.6 degrees). Pulse is normal or raised slightly. Pupils may contract. Urination decreases and the person may vomit.
Heat stroke: this is life-threatening. Immediate medical attention is required. Death can occur quickly when heat stroke occurs. Body temperature rises above 100 degrees F (some sources say 104 degrees F), and the person may become confused, combative, behave bizarrely, feel faint, stagger. Pulse is rapid. Skin is dry, flushed and may feel hot. Lack of sweating. Breathing may be fast and shallow. Pupils may widen or dilate. Delirium, seizures or convulsions, and coma are possible.
To alleviate symptoms for any heat-related problem and while waiting for medical help:
Have the person lie down in a cool place.
Elevate the feet.
Apply cool, wet cloths or water to the skin, especially the head, groin and armpits which cool quickly.
Fan by hand or with an electric fan.
If possible, give small sips of cool water (no salt without a doctor’s approval)
Do not use rubbing alcohol.
And remember — if you suspect heat stroke, call 911 or summon medical personnel immediately.
Following a heat stress episode, a person will likely feel tired and weak for several days. Continued monitoring is important.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease/,Huntington’s Disease,"Huntington’s Disease (HD) is an inherited brain disorder and neurodegenerative illness. As the condition progresses, symptoms worsen, and people need more care.
Symptoms appear most often between 30 and 50 years old. Early signs can include irritability, depression, involuntary movements, poor coordination, and trouble making decisions.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease/,Huntington’s Disease,"We all carry a gene called the HTT gene, located on chromosome 4, which makes a protein called Huntingtin. Mutations in this gene are responsible for HD.
Long strands of building blocks of DNA make up genes. HD’s genetic mutation causes a “genetic stutter” in the code that makes up the gene’s instructions. In other words, in those DNA strands, specific genetic code repeats – appearing more times than is normal.
If it’s hard to imagine, picture this: You’re on your computer doing your taxes – and in one of your calculations, you unknowingly lean on a number key for several seconds. You wind up with a bunch of extra digits in that field, which affects all the rest of your calculations.
A genetic stutter is similar – repeating bits of genetic code, often many times more often than it should. The longer those building blocks of DNA in the genetic code repeat, the earlier the onset of symptoms.
While people with the genetic mutation can live without symptoms for years, symptoms will likely develop at some point. We do not yet know what triggers the onset of symptoms, and there is no way of knowing when symptoms will start.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease/,Huntington’s Disease,"Since HD causes nerve cell loss in the brain’s basal ganglia, HD affects an individual’s ability to move, think, and process thoughts and feelings.
As HD progresses over time, neurons in the brain deteriorate, leading to further physical, cognitive, and psychological decline. Clinicians often divide the progression of HD into the early, middle and late stages. Each stage marks a loss in ability.
Today, there is no cure for HD, and there is no medication available to stop, reverse, or slow the disease’s course. Once symptoms begin, life expectancy usually ranges from 10 to 15 years. Because it is a progressive disease, the time will come when a person with HD needs others to care for them. Common causes of death with HD include infections (often aspiration pneumonia), fall-related injuries, and heart failure.
This condition also affects family and friends who care for people with HD. It’s important for these people to get information and support for themselves, as well as practice self care.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease/,Huntington’s Disease,"Though once considered rare, HD is one of the more frequently encountered hereditary diseases. It affects both women and men and all ethnic groups. In the United States, an estimated 30,000 people have Huntington’s Disease. Approximately 200,000 Americans are at risk of inheriting the disease from an affected parent. Other key facts regarding the genetics of HD:
Those who have a parent with HD have a 50 percent (i.e., one in two) chance of inheriting the defective gene.
When a parent has HD, each child has an equal chance of inheriting the illness.
If one child inherits the gene, it does not necessarily mean the others will also.
HD does not skip generations; if a child does not inherit the gene, they cannot pass the gene on to future generations.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease/,Huntington’s Disease,"An individual with Huntington’s disease often has problems in three areas: control of body movement, cognitive (or mental) functioning, and psychological issues. The intensity and number of symptoms vary case by case. Symptoms experienced by those with HD may include:
Movement: Quick, dance-like, uncontrollable movements of the limbs are typical of those with HD and are commonly called chorea by health professionals. Movements of the torso and face are the most obvious. All movement disorders tend to progress over time, both in frequency and severity. Movements may be grossly exaggerated, causing what was intended to be a small movement to be uncoordinated and dramatic. For example, an intended small shift in bed may cause the individual to instead vault out of bed. Eventually rigidity or muscle stiffness may occur. Walk may become unsteady, or even appear as if the person is drunk. Speech may be slurred, and it may be difficult to pronounce words. In later stages of the disease, swallowing becomes increasingly difficult (dysphagia), and choking is a major concern.
 Cognitive: Huntington’s disease causes changes in the brain that slow processing of information and hamper organizational ability. The person you care for may find it increasingly difficult to plan and carry out normal household tasks or projects, cope with new situations, or switch from task to task (multi-tasking). Because individuals with HD have difficulty processing information, they may have difficulty remembering words, and the act of speaking may become challenging. Individuals with HD may exhibit poor judgment and problems with short-term memory. Declining cognitive function is common as the disease progresses, although those with HD continue to recognize their caregivers, are aware of what is happening around them, and can give feedback about their condition and care.
 Psychological: Some people with HD may have difficulty controlling impulses and emotions, resulting in outbursts or aggression. Mild to severe depression, common in most individuals with chronic, long-term conditions, is one of the primary complaints of HD. Other psychological symptoms include irritability and anxiety. Some individuals may exhibit schizophrenic-like behavior, such as hallucinations, mania, anxiety, and psychosis.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease/,Huntington’s Disease,"Physicians usually diagnose HD through a full medical history, laboratory and neurological tests, brain imaging and a genetic test.
A thorough neurological exam that uses the Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS), as well as an extensive patient and family medical history, can confirm the presence of HD. A physician or neurologist familiar with HD can make this determination.
Genetic testing is the most conclusive and definitive way to determine if your friend or family member will develop, or has developed, Huntington’s disease.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease/,Huntington’s Disease,"In 1993, the discovery of the gene that causes Huntington’s disease led to the development of a direct gene test for HD. A blood test can predict Huntington’s disease before symptoms develop but cannot identify when symptoms will appear.
In addition to a thorough neurological exam, it is recommended that a person obtain genetic counseling before being tested so that they can have support as they go through the testing process, as well as a chance to explore the ramifications of a positive or negative result. A post-test follow-up appointment with the genetic counselor is also recommended.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease/,Huntington’s Disease,"A second blood test, called a confirmatory test, confirms the presence of the HD gene. The procedure for this test is the same as the pre-symptomatic test, but the test is given after symptoms of the disease appear.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease/,Huntington’s Disease,"Prenatal testing is available to determine if a fetus carries the HD gene. Most health professionals recommend not testing children and instead waiting until they are at least 18 years old. Most children don’t yet have the emotional development and tools to manage that kind of news. Imagine being a child or teen and knowing that you will have that disease at some point in your future, but not knowing when. It’s a heavy burden. In the absence of a cure, many at-risk individuals choose to live with uncertainty, rather than take the test. It’s an intensely personal and potentially life-changing decision which is best discussed with a professional genetics counselor and loved ones.
Finding a testing center that follows the Huntington’s Disease Society of America (HDSA) guidelines for genetic testing is very important. HDSA regularly updates its list of testing centers, and it can be found on their website.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease/,Huntington’s Disease,"Robust research continues in search of strategies to fight and cure HD.
While efforts to develop a cure are underway, researchers are also focusing on how to delay the onset of HD or to slow – even stop – the progression. Other research efforts with animal models are identifying the effects of HD, how it manifests, and if or how successful animal trials can be translated to treatments that work in humans. Both basic (laboratory) and clinical (testing of medications and treatments) research continue to help new drug testing.
To stay informed of, or take part in, ongoing clinical trials, contact HD Trailfinder (https://hdsa.org/hd-research/hd-trial-finder/), HD Buzz (https://en.hdbuzz.net/) or Hopes (https://hopes.stanford.edu/clinical-trials-on-huntingtons-disease/).",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease/,Huntington’s Disease,"Although no medications exist yet that halt or slow the progression of HD, much can be done to manage the symptoms of it:
To reduce involuntary movements, physicians often prescribe neuroleptic drugs.
For psychological symptoms or emotional disorders, anti-depressants or anti-psychotic medications are often recommended.
Families should proceed with caution when using new medications, as some individuals with HD may be more sensitive to side effects than others. It is important to document side effects of new medications or changes in behavior after a medication has been added to the routine of the person you care for.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease/,Huntington’s Disease,"Many other non-medical treatments can assist those with HD and the individuals caring for them.
Exercise is the number one treatment to combat depression and other mood disorders, as well as agitation and fatigue. Research has shown it can also help slow down the progression of HD.
Physical therapy can address early balance and walking problems and provide exercises to build strength. Occupational therapy can provide strategies to help people with HD do tasks and hobbies, as well as make the home safer and more livable, improve communication, and suggest ideas to offset cognitive decline. A few organizational techniques that have been found to be helpful include:
labeling items around the house (e.g., identifying the contents of drawers and cabinets in the kitchen and bathroom)
using a whiteboard, lists and notes
communicating with short, direct instructions
Because HD affects metabolism, people with HD may burn calories at a much higher than average rate, so maintaining a high-calorie diet is necessary. A registered dietitian can assist with diet changes and meal planning.
Support from a speech therapist is helpful across all stages of the disease, as the ability to communicate becomes impaired. A speech therapist can also evaluate swallowing problems and make necessary recommendations to ease these difficulties.",huntingtons-disease

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease/,Huntington’s Disease,"It can be overwhelming to coordinate care and to find appropriate resources and professionals who are trained in HD care. However, these professionals do exist and HDSA is a good referral sources as they have information for providers across the United States. People with HD often interact with multiple providers such as physicians, social workers, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, nutritionists, and other health care providers. By seeking early intervention from these professionals, people with HD can have more control over their disease progression and ultimately over their well-being.
Keeping a notebook or “health journal” of interactions with health care providers, procedures, and medication regimens, will help to keep appointments organized and provide a personal record of care.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease/,Huntington’s Disease,"Due to the strong emotional impact of the diagnosis of this chronic, hereditary condition, and the stress of knowing that others in the family may be at risk, participation in support groups can be very helpful. Support groups provide a safe, confidential and caring environment in which to share information about individual experiences and challenges of HD with others in similar situations. Topics discussed include, providing care throughout the disease course, coping strategies, family dynamics, sharing frustrations, as well as practical information regarding navigating insurance, medication, and more. Both online and in-person support groups are available for individuals with HD, their family caregivers, and for those living at risk. Counseling also may be helpful for individuals, couples, or families who are learning to cope with chronic illness or periodic health crises.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease/,Huntington’s Disease,"Individuals who help a friend or family member with HD may be at increased risk of poor health, depression, and isolation. It is important for the health of the family caregiver, as well as the health of the person with HD, for their caregivers to take some time off from caregiving (known as respite), get enough sleep, and have a support system of their own. Respite can be obtained with the help of family members, friends, volunteer services, home care agencies, adult day health centers, social service organizations, or assisted living communities. Caregivers who make time for themselves can give better care to their friends and family members. For more information, see Family Caregiver Alliance’s Fact Sheet, Taking Care of YOU: Self-Care for Family Caregivers.
Finally, it is critical that people with HD know there is hope. Research is moving us closer every day toward new treatments and a potential cure. With what we have learned about strategies for coping with the effects of HD, a growing number of individuals with Huntington’s Disease are living meaningful lives and remain productive well into the later stages of the disease.",huntingtons-disease

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Huntington’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"This article provides useful tools to help you care for an adult living with Huntington’s Disease (HD). It is based on the video, Huntington’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone. You may not feel prepared for this role but know that there are resources and a community of HD caregivers to help you.
We’ll look at the early, middle, and late stages of Huntington’s disease and focus on caregiving information and recommendations related to each stage. We’ll also cover what to expect as HD progresses, how to prepare, and provide strategies to help you along the way.
Let’s start with a quick overview of Huntington’s Disease. HD is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by the mutation of a single gene. Three major areas impacted by HD include:
Movement
Memory
Mood
Although, HD can occur in children as well as adults, many people with HD will begin to experience symptoms in mid-life. Keep in mind that the disease may progress differently for each person.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Huntington’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"In the early stage of Huntington’s disease, people are generally independent and can care for themselves. Early symptoms may include:
Chorea: Involuntary motor movements, such as twitches or tremors, that often begin in the face and hands.
Mood and Behavioral Changes (Anxiety, Sadness): Mood can be affected, and a person may begin to suffer from anxiety and depression. They may become more irritable and angrier. Be sure to let a doctor know if you notice any of these symptoms.
Suicidal Thoughts: If the person expresses suicidal thoughts or doesn’t want to go on living with the disease, it’s important to connect them with help immediately.
Receiving this diagnosis, and experiencing these changes, can be very distressing. Participating in a support group for people with early-stage HD can help the person you care for ease their distress and learn pro-active coping skills. Individual counseling can also be very helpful. One helpful resource is the National Suicide Prevention Helpline (800-273-8255)",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Huntington’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"Make educating yourself about Huntington’s Disease a priority during the early stages of the disease.
Connect with a genetic counselor: Because HD is a genetic illness, you may be wondering if you should get tested for it. Genetic counselors can provide information, support, and guidance. Before getting tested, it is highly recommended that you meet with a genetic counselor.
Learn all you can about Huntington’s and connect with medical providers who have experience with the disease. People living with HD will benefit from a healthcare team comprised of a primary care doctor, a neurologist, and a psychiatrist. The Huntington’s Disease Society of America website includes information on the HDSA Centers of Excellence across the United States. This is a good place to find medical specialists experienced in HD.
Explore available medications and therapies: Although there are no cures for Huntington’s yet, there are medications to treat and manage the symptoms. You may also want to explore current research opportunities for HD-specific trials.
Reach out to local resources: Social workers can help connect you to resources and referrals in your community, as well as provide you with supportive counseling.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Huntington’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"How are you feeling about your loved one’s diagnosis? Sadness, anger, fear? Disbelief? Perhaps you feel relief at having an explanation for the unusual changes you’ve been observing. All of these feelings are normal.
Huntington’s disease can progress over 10 to 20 years. As a caregiver, it’s very important to find support — even before you think you need it.
It’s normal for caregivers to feel grief and loss throughout the disease process. Two types of loss that are common for caregivers are ambiguous loss and anticipatory grief. Ambiguous loss is the grief we experience when someone is “there but not there” – when they are not the same person they used to be. Anticipatory grief occurs when we know a loss is coming and begin grieving before they are gone.
Although there is no one right way, there are healthy ways to deal with your grief such as getting support early, being aware and accepting your feelings, and taking time to grieve.
Healthy ways to grieve may include:
Writing in a journal can help you to name and express your feelings. Many caregivers find journaling useful, even therapeutic.
Physical exercise, prayer, meditation, relaxation exercises, support groups, talking one-on-one with a friend or counselor, and creating new rituals can help you stay well.
Make the time to do things you find fun and fulfilling.
Finding ways to reduce stress is a priority for HD caregivers.
Huntington’s is a disease that affects everyone in the family in different ways. This includes you as the caregiver, the person with HD, their relatives, and friends. Each will require their own kind of support.
Children who have a parent with HD may benefit from talking to a counselor and checking out resources designed specifically for children on the HDSA website.
Be aware that you may not have the support and understanding you need from those around you. They may not have experience as caregivers and can’t relate to what you’re going through. Caregiver support groups offer a safe, caring environment to share experiences and learn from others in similar situations. Support groups are free, online and in-person.
Both you and the person you care for will have to learn to balance HD symptoms and care needs with the desire to be independent. You both should keep dates with friends, keep up with interests and hobbies, and do the things that you enjoy.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Huntington’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"A common question caregivers ask, is what will happen to the person I care for if something happens to me? One thing to do is to make sure that your own legal and financial documents are updated.
This is also a good time to encourage the person with HD to make or update legal and financial arrangements, especially before they experience significant cognitive changes. For them it’s best to speak with an attorney who specializes in disability and estate planning. Key documents to complete include:
Durable power of attorney for finances
Advance Health Care Directive
Will and/or trust
POLST or DNR
This is also the time for the person with HD to sign a release of information to allow medical staff to speak with you and others who are closely involved in their care.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Huntington’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"Employee Benefits: If you or the person with HD is employed, it is important to contact the Human Resources department to learn about eligible benefits, such as long-term disability and paid and unpaid family leave options.
Government Disability Benefits: Securing financial help from the government can be a challenging and confusing process. We recommend seeking out experts to help you early on. Consult with an attorney, a community organization or legal aid office that specializes in Social Security Disability Insurance, or SSDI, and Supplemental Security Income, or SSI. They can also help you navigate Medicare and Medicaid.
Medicare: A person is eligible for Medicare when:
they turn 65 or if they become disabled before 65
have been receiving SSDI for 24 months.
they turn 65 or if they become disabled before 65

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Huntington’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"Note: It is important to note that Medicare does not pay for long-term care beyond the first 100 days, such as an assisted living or skilled nursing facility.
Long-term Care Insurance is only available if obtained before receiving the diagnosis. The person you care for may be eligible for long-term care through Medicaid if their assets and financial resources are low enough.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Huntington’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"During the middle stage of Huntington’s Disease, a person will need more help with basic personal care, such as bathing, dressing, and brushing their teeth. They may experience more difficulty thinking clearly, and display more behavioral changes, such as inhibition, impulsiveness, or aggression.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Huntington’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"As the disease advances, it is common for caregivers to feel isolated and overwhelmed.
Too often, just when you really need more support, friends and even family may stay away due to their inability to witness your pain and the person for whom you care’s decline. It’s common that friends or relatives may not have an understanding of the disease, and they might have a difficult time knowing the type of support that you need. Reach out with suggestions of specific ways they could be more supportive. Some people also find that a facilitated family meeting can help. Follow up with a social worker for more information.
If you’re feeling depressed, anxious, or angry, know that these emotions are hard to deal with on your own. Consider talking with your doctor or counselor and attending a support group or a retreat designed for caregivers.
Caregivers often don’t feel they need respite until they experience a crisis or problem with their own health. Some signs that you need a break include:
Health issues, like a rash or an ache, that doesn’t go away.
Rising blood pressure.
Not managing your own chronic health conditions.
Trouble sleeping.
Feeling anxious, irritable and less patient.
Turning to alcohol or drugs in an effort to relieve your stress.
These are all signs that you need more support and time to take care of yourself.
There are effective ways to help you cope and feel better. Don’t wait to ask for help!
Take a break!… Respite can come from a family member, friend, or in-home professional.
You can also create self-care moments throughout the day by taking small, intentional breaks for yourself, even if it’s just 15 minutes to drink a cup of tea, exercise, or engage in another enjoyable activity of your choice.
And if you need more time-off, there are out-of-home respite options, like adult day programs or a short-term stay in a 24-hour care facility.
Remember, as HD progresses, it’s easy to put-off your own healthcare needs. Be sure to prioritize your physical and emotional well-being! Keep your doctor or therapist appointments, visit with friends, and do activities you enjoy. Self-care benefits both you and the person you care for.
It may cause you anxiety to take time for yourself because you worry something bad will happen, or you feel guilty doing it. The truth is, it’s essential to confront these concerns and make time to step outside of the caregiver role.
To find respite and other support services near you, contact your local Area Agency on Aging. Go to the Family Caregiver Alliance Family Caregiver Services by State or use the National Eldercare Locator. Check with your local Center for Independent Living and if the person with HD is a veteran, contact the VA Caregiver Support Program to see what resources they offer.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Huntington’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"Because HD causes motor changes, it’s important to identify potential hazards that may exist in the home.
Get a PT assessment: A Physical Therapist, or PT, can do an in-home safety evaluation and suggest modifications, such as bathroom grab-bars for getting in and out of the shower. PTs can also recommend other types of equipment and strategies to prevent falls and injury.
Get an OT assessment: An Occupational Therapist, or OT, helps promote independence and safety for the person living with HD. They can help identify ways to complete daily activities and manage personal care. They also have a wide knowledge of assistive devices.
HD ID card and bracelet: For personal safety outside the home, we recommend that the person with HD carry a card stating they have Huntington’s and wear an ID bracelet with emergency contact information.
Reach out to local police and fire departments: Because the disease can cause behavioral changes which can lead to 911 calls, consider reaching out ahead of time to your local police or fire department.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Huntington’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"Get referrals for these types of professionals:
Speech therapist: People with HD may develop difficulty swallowing their food and beverages. A speech therapist can determine what is causing the swallowing difficulties and make recommendations to reduce the risk of coughing or choking.
Dietician: Difficulty eating and swallowing, as well as the general progression of HD, can cause weight loss, which can lead to infections and pressure sores. People with HD require a higher caloric intake. A dietician can guide you on proper nutrition to support a healthy weight and immune system.
Palliative care is a type of supportive healthcare to improve the quality of life for people with chronic conditions. Palliative care teams can help to manage symptoms and reduce suffering. And you don’t have to be in hospice to qualify.
Contact the person with HD’s medical team for referrals to any of these services. You are their advocate; and their connection to care and helpful services.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Huntington’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"A person in late-stage HD will need help with all of their personal care. They will experience muscle rigidity or stiffness, as well as involuntary spasms.
Swallowing: Just swallowing food can become a major challenge. Be aware food or liquid inhaled into the lungs can lead to aspiration pneumonia, one of the most common causes of death for someone with HD.
Communication: A person with HD’s ability to speak and communicate their needs will be very limited. Use eye contact, touch, and a calm voice to reassure them. There are also communication boards and other tools that may help. Talk with the medical team, including a speech therapist, about interventions to reduce pain or suffering.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Huntington’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"There often comes a time when the person living with HD requires a higher level of care than can be provided at home.
Moving the person to a nursing facility can be a tough decision, but a necessary one. You may feel like you’ve failed or that you’re breaking a promise – even when you know placement will provide more safety and advanced care.
We highly encourage you to connect with a caregiver support group or local HD program to hear from others with similar experiences. They will often have good recommendations about placement options and coping with care decisions.
If you’re considering a skilled nursing facility, it’s helpful to get a list of local options and to visit. Social workers, care managers, and others can help you figure out if the cost of placement is covered by Medicaid, long-term care insurance or VA benefits. Check https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/ for ratings of skilled nursing facilities.
Even when the person for whom you care moves to a skilled nursing facility, this doesn’t mean that your role as a caregiver ends. Your ongoing presence and advocacy will help ensure that proper care is provided.",huntingtons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/huntingtons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Huntington’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"Hospice services are designed to support individuals towards the end of life. Here are some important things to know about hospice:
Hospice is a Medicare benefit.
Individuals are eligible when a doctor has determined a patient has six months or less to live.
The goal of hospice is making the patient as comfortable as possible.
Care can be provided wherever the person resides, including at home or in a facility. This care includes visiting nurses, pain management, and personal care.
Hospice can also provide spiritual, grief, and bereavement support, as well as respite for family caregivers.
The doctor or medical team may have a particular hospice program they recommend. Also, the Hospice and Palliative Care Organization provide a site to search for hospice programs within the United States. Once you have selected a hospice, you can ask the doctor for a referral to begin services or the hospice can assist you in getting a referral from the doctor if the patient is eligible.",huntingtons-disease

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hypoxic-anoxic-brain-injury/,Hypoxic-Anoxic Brain Injury,"The brain requires a constant flow of oxygen to function normally. A hypoxic-anoxic injury, also known as HAI, occurs when that flow is disrupted, essentially starving the brain and preventing it from performing vital biochemical processes. Hypoxic refers to a partial lack of oxygen; anoxic means a total lack. In general, the more complete the deprivation, the more severe the harm to the brain and the greater the consequences.
The diminished oxygen supply can cause serious impairments in cognitive skills, as well as in physical, psychological, and other functions. Recovery can occur in many cases, but it depends largely on the parts of the brain affected, and its pace and extent are unpredictable.
As a result, HAI can have a catastrophic impact on the lives not only of those injured, but also for their families, friends, and caregivers as well. Treatment can be costly and complicated, especially because HAI patients frequently need substantial medical and rehabilitative help and may suffer from significant long-term disabilities. A shortage of easy-to-understand, accessible information about HAI can make the situation even more stressful for affected individuals and their families. This fact sheet will help answer your questions about this condition.
 ",hypoxic-anoxic-brain-injury
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hypoxic-anoxic-brain-injury/,Hypoxic-Anoxic Brain Injury,"Why is oxygen important to us? Our bodies require oxygen in order to metabolize glucose. This process provides energy for the cells. The brain consumes about a fifth of the body’s total oxygen supply, and needs energy to transmit electrochemical impulses between cells and to maintain the ability of neurons to receive and respond to these signals.
Cells of the brain will start to die within a few minutes if they are deprived of oxygen. The result is a cascade of problems. In particular, the disruption of the transmission of electrochemical impulses impacts the production and activity of important substances called neurotransmitters, which regulate many cognitive, physiological, and emotional processes.
There are many neurotransmitters, and they perform a wide variety of important functions, although the specific ways neurotransmitters work are not fully understood. Some neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, play an important role in regulating moods. Endorphins are critical for controlling pain and enhancing pleasure, while acetylcholine is important for memory functions.
A variety of disease processes and injuries can cause HAI. The most common is called hypoxicischemic injury, also known as HII or stagnant anoxia. This occurs when some internal event prevents enough oxygen-rich blood from reaching the brain. While strokes and cardiac arrhythmia can both result in HII, the most frequent cause is cardiac arrest.
Anesthesia accidents and cardiovascular disease each account for just under a third of cardiac arrests, according to a 1989 study. Other possible causes are asphyxia, generally caused by suicide attempts or near-drownings (16 percent), chest trauma (10 percent), electrocution (6.5 percent), severe bronchial asthma (3 percent), and barbiturate poisoning (3 percent).
Occasionally, HAI is caused by anoxic anoxia, which is when the air itself does not contain enough oxygen to be absorbed and used by the body. This can occur at high altitudes, where the air is thinner than at sea level, but is extremely unusual otherwise. Another syndrome, toxic anoxia, involves the presence in the body of toxins or other substances that may interfere with the way an individual processes oxygen.
Another occasional cause of HAI is anemic anoxia, which can occur when someone does not have enough blood or hemoglobin, a chemical in the red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body. Acute hemorrhage, chronic anemia, and carbon monoxide poisoning are conditions that can result in anemic anoxia.
Acute hemorrhage is essentially massive bleeding, caused, for example, by a gunshot or other wound. Chronic anemia is an ailment in which a person suffers from persistently low levels of red blood cells or hemoglobin. Carbon monoxide poisoning, which appears to damage parts of the brain controlling movement, occurs in suicide attempts using automobile exhaust, but can also happen due to malfunctioning furnaces and other accidents involving machinery and industrial equipment.
 ",hypoxic-anoxic-brain-injury
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hypoxic-anoxic-brain-injury/,Hypoxic-Anoxic Brain Injury,"HAI is generally marked by an initial loss of consciousness or coma, a condition which looks like sleep but from which a person cannot be awakened. The period of unconsciousness, whether short or long, might be followed by a persistent vegetative state, in which a person is neither comatose nor responsive to external stimuli. This state is frequently referred to as “wakeful unresponsiveness.”
Even when a person has fully recovered consciousness, he or she might suffer from a long list of symptoms. In many ways, these symptoms are similar to those commonly seen after a blow to the head. The effects can vary widely depending upon the part of the brain that has been injured and the extent of the damage. Some of the major cognitive (thought) problems are:
Short-term memory loss. This is the most common cognitive symptom, especially among those who have HII. The reason is that the part of the brain that is believed to be responsible for learning new information, called the hippocampus, has neurons that are highly sensitive to oxygen deprivation.
Decline in executive functions. Disruption of such critical tasks as reasoning, making judgments, and synthesizing information. This can lead to impulsive behavior, poor decision-making, inability to direct, divide, or switch attention.
Difficulty with words, also known as anomia. These linguistic problems include not being able to remember the right word, selecting the wrong word, confusing similar words, not understanding commonly used words, and so on.
Visual disturbances. Difficulty processing visual information can occur in some cases. One rare disorder is called cortical blindness, in which the area of the brain responsible for vision becomes disconnected from the rest of the brain. Because the brain cannot tell that this part is damaged, people may appear to act as though they can see even though they display no ability to identify or recognize objects, shapes, or colors.
Some common physical deficits are:
Ataxia, or a lack of coordination. This often expresses itself as a sort of bobbing or weaving, similar to what is seen in people who are drunk. 
Apraxia, or an inability to execute a familiar sequence of physical movements such as brushing teeth, combing hair, using eating utensils, etc.
Spasticity, rigidity and myoclonus, disorders which can include a tendency toward jerky motions, trembling of the extremities, or other abnormal movements.
Quadriparesis, a weakness of the arms and legs.
Other symptoms can include: hallucinations and delusions; increased agitation and confusion; depression and other mood disorders; personality changes, such as irritability and a reduced threshold for frustration; and an inability to focus or concentrate.
 ",hypoxic-anoxic-brain-injury
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hypoxic-anoxic-brain-injury/,Hypoxic-Anoxic Brain Injury,"Because people with HAI have often suffered extensive damage, complete recovery is not assured. In fact, predicting the outcome of HAI is a bit like estimating how high a rocket will go. There are some general factors that are helpful in making initial forecasts, but the actual course of the rocket is also dependent upon real-world conditions and many unforeseeable variables.
Studies that have been done suggest that recovery may be more limited than in cases where a person has suffered a traumatic brain injury of comparable severity. Nonetheless, there are some clues that can clearly offer a bit of guidance in judging the likelihood of at least a partial recovery. These include:
Length of coma. As you might expect, the longer a person is in a coma, the less promising the outcome, although individual cases can vary dramatically from the norm. One study suggested that if a coma lasts less than 12 hours, there is likely to be little long-term damage. Another study indicated that 21 percent of HIA patients who remained in a coma for four weeks or less experienced a good recovery, while the recovery for others was poor. 
Many patients come out of a coma but remain in what is called a persistent vegetative state, a sort of wakeful unresponsiveness in which some brain functions continue to operate but with no apparent consciousness. Some doctors believe that if the persistent vegetative state in a patient with HAI continues for more than three months, there is virtually no chance of further recovery.
Visual cues. If both eyes have fixed or dilated pupils, the prognosis is generally poor. Since this can indicate significant damage to the brain stem, the area of the brain responsible for regulating such basic functions as breathing, the outcome is not promising. Neurologists can also conduct tests to measure some standard eye-movement responses to determine what kind of damage has been suffered. 
Age. Some studies suggest that patients younger than 25 have a better rate of recovery than those who are older.
Brain imaging tests, such as MRI or CT scans. Acute brain damage that has occurred in the immediate past does not typically show up on this type of scan. However, imaging tests conducted several months down the line may indicate the atrophy or loss of some brain matter.
Electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potentials (EPs). An EEG that reveals continued cortical activity is a positive sign. An EP, which charts electrical activity arising in response to outside stimuli, can also give some indication of the state of the brain after HAI. ",hypoxic-anoxic-brain-injury
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hypoxic-anoxic-brain-injury/,Hypoxic-Anoxic Brain Injury,"Unfortunately, direct treatment of anoxia is limited. Some studies have suggested that the use of barbiturates, which slow down the brain’s activity, may be helpful in the first two or three days after the onset of the injury. Otherwise, the general medical approach is to maintain the body’s status.
Once a person’s condition has been stabilized, the next question is to what extent he or she can recover. Recovery can take many months and even years, and in many cases the person never regains his or her prior level of functioning. In general, the sooner rehabilitation starts, the better.
During rehabilitation, the individual and family members may interact with a variety of professionals as the need for constant medical attention from a doctor decreases. Such professionals may include a physical therapist, who aids in improving motor skills such as walking; an occupational therapist, who assists in retraining the person to perform skills of daily living, such as dressing and going to the bathroom; a speech therapist, who may help address cognitive problems as well as language disorders; and a neuropsychologist, who may assess the level and type of cognitive impairment, collaborate on retraining, and assist both the individual and family members with behavior and emotional issues.
 ",hypoxic-anoxic-brain-injury
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/hypoxic-anoxic-brain-injury/,Hypoxic-Anoxic Brain Injury,"As recovery may take months and even years, it is important for both the patient and family members involved in rehabilitation efforts to establish a good working relationship with the various specialists. It’s important to understand that rehab often proceeds in an unpredictable way, with progress measured in small steps rather than giant leaps.
Patients and family caregivers, therefore, often experience intense bouts of frustration at what they perceive to be the slow pace of recovery. Expectations and hope may at times outstrip the person’s actual level of progress, and the potential for disappointment and misunderstanding—between patient and family, or caregivers and rehabilitation professionals—can be significant. 
While the process will never be easy, the following tips may help to minimize possible tension and conflict:
Find out as early as possible who will be part of the rehab team. Get to know the professionals as soon as they begin working with the patient. Ask them for a realistic assessment of the situation. What can you and the patient expect? What is the bare minimum they hope to achieve? What is the likely outcome? What is the most optimistic forecast? This way, you will understand the range of possibilities and can gauge your expectations accordingly.
Learn as much as possible about the role of each of the rehabilitation specialists. Ask them how you can make their jobs easier. Are there steps you need to take to prepare the patient for them each day? Are there exercises you can help with? Are there times you would be better off staying out of the way?
Stay informed and involved. Family members and friends can play a critical role in monitoring care, charting progress, providing support to both the patient and the professionals, and answering any questions that may arise. Working as a team is one way to help maximize the recovery potential.
Plan regular meetings for family members and friends involved in the caregiving process. This will give everyone a chance to exchange information, voice concerns, and stay on top of the changing situation. If possible, invite one or more of the rehabilitation professionals so they can fill in the group as a whole rather than having to repeat information to every individual.
Recovery can be completely unpredictable, and the love of those around a patient can play a key role in stimulating progress. Motivation is an important factor, and someone who feels supported in his or her efforts may well find greater reserves of internal strength to press forward with the rehabilitation process.
Celebrate every success, not just the big ones. The first time the patient takes a step unaided, handles a fork properly, or remembers someone’s name should be considered a major victory. Hopefully, more will follow, but it is important to take joy in every advance, small or large.",hypoxic-anoxic-brain-injury

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/incontinence-dementia/,Incontinence (for dementia),"Talk to the physician to see if medication, enlarged prostate or a urinary tract infection might be causing the problem, especially if there is a sudden onset of incontinence.
 
Investigate various incontinence supplies. There are many kinds of pads and underwear. Each person will have different needs and different products will work best for each one. A pad inside pull up underwear will provide increased absorption. Do not call them adult diapers, but rather protective underwear.
 People with dementia often resist wearing protective underwear. Some tricks might help, for example, incorporate the underpants as a natural part of getting dressed in the morning. Have pads in the underpants before handing them to your loved one when they are dressing or getting up from the toilet. If your loved one expresses resistance you could say to them, “This will help me to better care for you, because then I won’t have to worry,” or by saying, “This will help you because then you won’t have to rush to the bathroom and risk a fall.”
 Use rubber or disposable plastic protection pads for beds, chairs, car seats, etc.
 Do not shame a person. They did not do it intentionally and may become embarrassed. Call it an accident, and be matter of fact and reassuring about whatever happens.
 When going out, carry a change of protective underwear as well as a change of clothes, in case there is a problem. Search for places with family restrooms so that you can take the person to the bathroom that has more privacy especially if you are caring for someone of the opposite sex. It is easier to change a woman with a skirt or dress than one wearing pants.
 Use disposable gloves and flushable wipes if you are helping the person discard soiled adult pad/panty or change into clean clothing. There are odor-neutralizing sprays that are helpful.
 Have a container to put soiled pads or protective underwear next to the toilet. This will help you to dispose of them and will be a cue to the person not to put them into the toilet.
 If someone has bowel incontinence, it might be necessary to give him/her a shower. Follow the rules on the Bathing Tip sheet to make this process easier. Whenever you or the person with dementia comes in contact with urine or feces, it is important to wash your hands and their hands with soap and water or use gloves as appropriate.
 Have all the things you need at hand in the bathroom, e.g. protective underwear, pads, diaper pail, gloves, wipes, powder, creams/and lotions. You do not want to leave someone sitting on the toilet while you go to another room to get these things.",dementia

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/introducing-home-care-when-your-loved-one-says-no/,Introducing In-Home Care When Your Loved One Says ‘No’,"Desperate though caregivers may be for a temporary respite from their care responsibilites, many care recipients are resistant to strangers coming into their home to help. The help may be perceived as an invasion of privacy, a loss of independence, or a waste of money. Yet in-home assistance is often critical in offering caregivers a break and time to relax and rejuvenate.
There are ways to make this transition easier. Here are some tips for making your loved one feel more comfortable with in-home help:
1. Start gradually.
Begin by having the aide come only a couple of hours each week, then add hours as your loved one builds a relationship with the helper. If you feel comfortable with the attendant running errands or preparing meals that can be brought to the house, you can start with those services, which can be done outside the home.
2. Listen to your loved one’s fears and reasons for not wanting in-home care.
Express your understanding of those feelings. If possible, get your loved one involved in choosing the aide. He or she will feel more invested and comfortable with the decision.
3. “This is for me. I know you don’t need help.”
Expressing the need as yours, rather than the your loved one’s, helps maintain her sense of dignity and independence. You can also add that having someone stay at home allows you not to worry while you are gone. Make it clear that you will be coming back.
4. “This is prescribed by the doctor.”
Doctors are often seen as authority figures and your loved one may be more willing to accept help if she feels that she is required to do so.
5. “I need someone to help clean.”
Even if this is not the real reason, often people will allow someone in to clean when they “don’t need” care for themselves.
6. “This is a free service.”
This strategy may work if other family members are paying for the home care or if it is, in fact, provided without charge. Your loved one may be more open to using the service since she does not feel that she is spending money for it.
7. “This is my friend.”
By pretending that the attendant is a friend of yours you are relating the home care worker to the family. This can help with establishing trust and rapport. You can also say that your “friend” is the one who needs company and that by having him or her over your loved one is helping him out.
8. “This is only temporary.” 
This strategy depends on the condition of your loved one’s memory. If she often forgets what you say, then she may also forget that you said this. By presenting the situation as short-term, you will give some time for your loved one to form a relationship or become comfortable with home care as part of her daily routine, and give you a chance for a well-deserved break.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/legal-issues-lgbt-caregivers/,Legal Issues for LGBTQ+ Caregivers,"Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBTQ+) people have witnessed two of the most dramatic and far-reaching changes to their rights in the last few years. In 2010 Edith Windsor, a woman in her 80s, challenged the US Supreme Court (U.S. v. Windsor) in order to receive the pension of her deceased life partner, a partnership of 44 years duration. The pension had been denied to her because they were not married as husband and wife according to the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). On June 26, 2013, the US Supreme Court ruled that section 3 of DOMA that had defined marriage as between a man and a woman as husband and wife was unconstitutional. From that date forward, the federal government had to recognize same sex marriages approved of by the states. At the time only 37 states recognized and protected same sex marriage. Two years later to the day, on June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court’s long-awaited landmark decision in Obergefill v. Hodges handed down a guaranty to same sex couples in all the states throughout the nation the right to marry and the right to have those marriages recognized at the federal level. Both of these Supreme Court decisions greatly advanced LGBTQ+ rights.
Nevertheless, even with these decisions in place, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, in couples or not, will still face increasingly important legal and financial decisions as they age. These legal and financial decisions, the documents that enforce them, and the agents that you name in them will determine who has the legal authority to confer with your doctors and make medical decisions for you, and who has the legal authority to manage your financial resources if and when you become incapacitated, legally unable to act on your own behalf.
Unlike heterosexual aging adults who have extended families through marriage over generations, many LGBTQ+ people must often turn to their “family of choice” for caregiving needs. These chosen families are trusted and valued friends who have provided emotional and social support to one another over the years. Without written protections in place, these chosen family members will not be legally recognized, and could very easily be questioned or contested by a biological family member. You may know people who have had this experience.
As a caregiver to a spouse, partner, or friend, it is essential to discuss available legal protections and their limitations with the person for whom you care before that person becomes incapacitated. Time is of the essence. Incapacity can happen in a heartbeat with a stroke or in a car accident.
Because many of these documents are state-specific, it is best to work with an attorney in your state when putting together advance directives and other legal documents. For help finding an LGBTQ+-friendly attorney in your area, see the Resources section of this fact sheet.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/legal-issues-lgbt-caregivers/,Legal Issues for LGBTQ+ Caregivers,"For his or her own protection and for yours, estate planning is an absolute necessity for the person for whom you provide care. Every LGBTQ+ person should have these documents in place, but this is especially true for partnered LGBTQ+ people where illness has been identified or if a person is advancing in age and infirmities. Estate planning documents to have in place include:",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/legal-issues-lgbt-caregivers/,Legal Issues for LGBTQ+ Caregivers,"A Will (often called a Last Will and Testament) is a legal document that allows you to designate who will receive your property when you die, and how and when they will receive it. If there is not a properly executed* Will when a person dies, the laws of intestacy in the state in which he or she lives determine who gets everything unless there is a named beneficiary on the asset (i.e., on life insurance or an IRA), or if he or she held the property in joint tenancy with another (i.e., a home or bank account), or in trust (i.e., named on bonds or bank accounts).
A same-sex partner or a friend not named as a beneficiary in a Will, or as a joint tenant on a property deed or in trust, could find all the property belonging to the deceased going to the deceased’s children, parents, siblings, or other biological family members against the deceased’s intention. These undesirable results are easily avoided with a properly written Will. With the advent of the Internet and the availability of Will forms, it is very important that a Will be printed out and properly executed according the laws of the state.
Note: A Will is only effective when you die. It is only about what happens to your property when you die.
* Properly executed generally means that when you sign legal documents, it is in the presence of witnesses and in accordance with the laws of your state.
If an LGBTQ+ person has a minor child who has not been adopted by the same-sex partner, it is imperative that he or she execute a Will. Wills are the only form of testamentary document in which a Guardian of Minor Children may be nominated. In a Will, the testator may leave instructions about the child’s education and place of residence, and nominate the person or persons who will have authority in the event of a child’s illness. The nominated guardian will still have to be appointed by court order.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/legal-issues-lgbt-caregivers/,Legal Issues for LGBTQ+ Caregivers,"Another type of legal document that LGBTQ+ people receiving and giving care may want to consider is a Trust, also called a Living Trust or a Revocable Trust. Like a Will, a Trust provides for an orderly distribution to beneficiaries of a person’s assets upon death. But, unlike a Will, a Trust also has incapacity language in it, which may become effective before death. Also, unlike a Will which simply lists your assets to be distributed, assets must be legally transferred into the Trust; it then holds these assets “in trust.” Should a trustor (the person making the Trust) become unable (incapacitated), for whatever reason or however long, to properly manage his or her estate, a named successor trustee may step in and exercise those powers during the trustor’s life that have been enumerated in the trust. Trusts are also important because they avoid a Probate at death. Probate is a court-controlled distribution of the deceased’s property. In California, Probate is a long and costly process.
Note: It is a good idea to ask an attorney to compare trusts and Wills to help you decide the most effective document for carrying out your wishes.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/legal-issues-lgbt-caregivers/,Legal Issues for LGBTQ+ Caregivers,"A Durable Power of Attorney, also known as a Durable Power of Attorney for Property and Finances (DPAP), will ensure that if a person becomes legally incapacitated, the designated agent (also called an “attorney-in-fact”) will have legal authority to manage all property, including real property, and financial affairs. For LGBTQ+ care receivers and caregivers, the Durable Power of Attorney for Property and Finances is a very powerful document. Without this documentation, an LGBTQ+ partner or friend will find that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to take care of important legal and financial transactions when a loved one is incapacitated. As with Wills, it is possible to download a DPAP form from the internet. Again, it is important that these be state specific and properly executed. If there is real property involved, the DPAP should be notarized.
Note: Banks are especially reluctant and often resistant to working with anyone but the person named on the account. Once a DPAP has been executed, it is a good idea to take it to the banks where there are assets and have it filed or otherwise recognized. Some banks will have their own forms; examine them carefully before you sign them. Always request that the DPAP be attached to any bank forms.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/legal-issues-lgbt-caregivers/,Legal Issues for LGBTQ+ Caregivers,"An Advance Health Care Directive (in California) or a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care (so named in most other states) ensures that all healthcare needs and desires are carried out and monitored by a trusted person—the agent or attorney-in-fact named in the document—when the principal can no longer make those decisions or communicate them to healthcare providers. This document contains the instructions regarding a care recipient’s wishes and desires for healthcare, including what end-of-life treatment is and is not desired, such as intubation, ventilators, or hydration. There is also room, on attorney-drafted forms, for burial, funeral, and memorial directions, as well as organ and whole body donation. A short form of the Advance Health Care Directive is available on the Internet. These are also state-specific. Again, once downloaded and printed out, the document must be properly executed.
Additional forms for healthcare include a Living Will; Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order; and a Physician’s Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST). Some people don’t have anyone they trust (or want to burden) to be their agent. They can still make their wishes about end-of-life care known directly to the medical personnel. Whichever documents they execute, a copy should be given to the primary physician and/or health care agency.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/legal-issues-lgbt-caregivers/,Legal Issues for LGBTQ+ Caregivers,"If the person for whom you care already has some or all of these documents drawn up, make sure they are up to date (current with state law, all assets are covered, proper beneficiaries are named, etc.) and complete. Banks have been known to refuse to honor a DPAP that is more than 2 or 3 years old. Deeds to houses and other property, insurance policies, and financial accounts should be examined to determine if the beneficiaries listed are up to date. Other components of an estate plan may include long-term care insurance with coverage for both in-home and nursing home care, and disability insurance. Ask the person for whom you care if he or she intends to use either of these to pay for care.
Note: All of these documents are vital to a person’s well-being in life and orderly distribution of assets at death. For these reasons, it is risky to rely on pre-packaged trust packages bought on the Internet or in a commercial publication. To protect yourself, it is essential that you consult a knowledgeable attorney who is familiar with the law in your state. See the list of available resources at the end of this article. ",[]

Reassessment of the property at the death of the first to die may result in an increase in property taxes, making it financially impossible for the surviving partner to keep the home. These property laws differ by state and within one state, in different counties. Making an appointment with an attorney or an accountant may be in order if this is a concern. It may be advisable to think seriously about investing in life insurance that could provide liquidity and assets to pay for increased property tax. If unmarried, creating and executing living-together and property agreements may also be desirable or practical at this time. An attorney working with you will be able to advise you or offer you the proper source of information.
We just reviewed these four estate planning documents. Which ones still need to be completed for your current and/or future caregiving situation?
Will
Living Trust
Durable Power of Attorney for Property and Finances
Advance Health Care Directive or Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/legal-issues-lgbt-caregivers/,Legal Issues for LGBTQ+ Caregivers,"Medicare is available to everyone who worked and accumulated enough years to be eligible at 65. Medicaid, on the other hand, is a means-tested program, available only to those whose assets meet the eligibility levels. Neither Medicare nor regular health insurance pays for ongoing custodial care provided in a skilled nursing facility or nursing home beyond specific short-term rehabilitation coverage. Care must be paid privately from a person’s assets, through private long-term care insurance policies, or by Medicaid. There are two major areas of concern caregivers should be aware of:
Medicaid eligibility regulations
Regulations controlling the recovery of monies paid out by Medicaid from the estate of the deceased recipient
Medicaid has very complex rules, which vary from state to state. LGBTQ+ caregivers should consult with an elder law attorney who is sensitive to LGBTQ+ issues and knowledgeable about Medicaid (Medi-Cal) regulations to determine how best to protect a home, savings, and any additional assets and property.
To find an elder law attorney, first ask friends in similar circumstances if they have worked with someone. LGBTQ+ groups or organizations in your area—especially LGBTQ+ senior organizations—may also be able to provide referrals, Also check the Resource section of this fact sheet. You may consider asking an estate planning attorney whom you know or have been referred to if they regularly work with someone on elder law issues, and you can contact the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys at www.naela.org.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/legal-issues-lgbt-caregivers/,Legal Issues for LGBTQ+ Caregivers,"Outside of the estate planning documents described above, your loved ones may also consider the following:
Living Will: A Living Will gives instructions for treatment and allows people to specify which life-sustaining actions should be taken in the event they can no longer make decisions or express their desires. It is directed to medical personnel and does not name an agent
Funeral Directive: Like other directives, a Funeral Directive will make sure your loved one’s wishes are respected. If those wishes are not recorded in a legal document, the law may default to allow “next of kin” to make decisions for him or her after death. If you are legal LGBTQ+ spouses or registered domestic partners, your ability to make decisions will probably be respected, but documenting who should be in charge and what the arrangements should look like can prevent conflict. For more information, see Lambda Legal’s Tools for Protecting Your Wishes for Your Funeral.
Hospital Visitation Directive: A Hospital Visitation Directive designates who may or may not visit someone in the hospital. Sometimes covered in the Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care or Advance Health Directive, it is best for LGBTQ+ patients to prepare a separate document clearly stating their desires. In 2010, President Obama issued a federal mandate guaranteeing visitation rights to LGBTQ+ domestic partners and families of choice in hospitals and care facilities receiving support from Medicare and Medicaid (virtually all facilities).",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/living-incontinence-social-and-emotional-challenges/,Living with Incontinence: Social and Emotional Challenges,"Most people who live with incontinence do not tell anyone about it, often not even their doctor(s) and especially not their friends. Family members might be the ones to bring up the subject, especially if the house is beginning to smell or furniture is soiled. It’s not an easy conversation to have. If you are faced with incontinence, know that you are not alone. One in 15 Americans are searching for ways to deal with this very personal issue. Here are typical feelings associated with continence issues and some coping strategies to consider:",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/living-incontinence-social-and-emotional-challenges/,Living with Incontinence: Social and Emotional Challenges,"Since becoming toilet trained as a youngster, we never expected that there would ever be a time when we were not going to be able to get to the bathroom on time, or would leak when we sneezed, coughed, or laughed. Certain conditions can even cause you to stop paying attention to your body cues to urinate or have a bowel movement. But now, as an adult, those with continence problems face a negative stigma and too often offensive communication from others. 
Coping: You can make it less embarrassing by admitting to it, making a joke, and understanding that this is very common. You have not failed. Your body is going through changes that you can’t control but can only manage the best way you know how.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/living-incontinence-social-and-emotional-challenges/,Living with Incontinence: Social and Emotional Challenges,"Outside of embarrassment and shame, you may also feel a sense of impatience, frustration, annoyance, anger, fear, and/or disgust. Or you may sense others experiencing having these reactions. It can feel dehumanizing, as if the condition has robbed you of your quality of life. Grief is triggered when one feels the loss of control, loss of privacy, loss of dignity, or loss of independence. Who do you talk to about all of these feelings? Does keeping these feelings inside make you feel depressed?
Coping: It’s important for you to find someone you can talk to about your feelings. Consider confiding in your physician, a counselor, possibly an incontinence support group, maybe your hairdresser, your sister, or a best friend. Keeping these feelings inside can only lead to a sense of sadness and possibly depression. Admitting to your feelings helps to “take the charge off” and normalize the situation.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/living-incontinence-social-and-emotional-challenges/,Living with Incontinence: Social and Emotional Challenges,"The bathroom is the ultimate place of privacy. We can close the door to the bathroom so that no one invades our space when we are there. To have someone come with us into the bathroom can cause a loss of dignity, sense of dependence, and loss of self. Using a commode next to the bed or a urinal will require weighing your need for privacy with your capacity for independence. You are not alone if you feel embarrassed about using products or needing help with these most basic of human functions. What if you need someone to help you wipe yourself? What if your bed partner wakes up to find the bed wet?
Coping: Think about what you find to be the hardest part(s) of needing help. Talk to your caregiver or others sharing your home about how this feels for you, and see what you can work out that will be more comfortable for those directly affected. For example, stashing pads and wipes in a bathroom cabinet and using an effective room deodorizer can help keep the issue private or at least from being ever-present for others who share the bathroom. Putting a drape over a commode and keeping the pot emptied can help normalize the environment.  ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/living-incontinence-social-and-emotional-challenges/,Living with Incontinence: Social and Emotional Challenges,"When you go out, do you think about how long you will be gone and where the bathrooms are along your route? Does cold weather make you more anxious about your ability to confidently leave home? Are you afraid to travel or make plans with friends for fear there won’t be a bathroom when you need one? Incontinence often leads to limiting activities, declining social invitations, and avoiding travel. The anxiety of trying to find a bathroom in a strange place or needing help from someone when you go to the bathroom may keep you from leaving the house. Always thinking about this issue is not only tremendously burdensome but can keep you from enjoying activities and companionship.
Coping: Carry extra protection with you, whether it’s pads, underwear, or both, to give yourself confidence knowing that you have extra security on-hand. Know that whatever happens can be dealt with. Let friends/family know that you have to stop frequently to use the bathroom. This allows everyone to plan accordingly. Coping by socially isolating yourself isn’t healthy. Isolation can lead to depression and increased risk for other illnesses. Allow others to help you search for solutions to help address this problem.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/living-incontinence-social-and-emotional-challenges/,Living with Incontinence: Social and Emotional Challenges,"It’s not easy to be odor free when you are living with incontinence. You may not smell anything out of the ordinary, as our sense of smell adapts over time to a constant odor. It’s also true that sense of smell decreases with both age and many chronic illnesses including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and stroke. If someone else brings up the topic—hopefully in a respectful way—be open to reevaluating what you can do to manage odor better.   
Coping: Denial happens when you don’t want to admit a problem.When someone else brings up the topic, be willing to discuss the problem and possible solutions. Talk with your physician, nurse, or an occupational therapist for more tips on managing and living well with incontinence.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/living-incontinence-social-and-emotional-challenges/,Living with Incontinence: Social and Emotional Challenges,"There are many products to help deal with incontinence. Different products help in different situations. What you use will depend on whether there is urinary incontinence only or also bowel incontinence, and whether you are dealing with a more advanced case of incontinence or simply minor leakage. Available products include commodes, urinals, pads, adult incontinence underwear (wrap-arounds or pull-ups), and plastic covers for the bed and a favorite chair or couch. Urinary incontinence in early stages can be dealt with by using absorbent pads in underwear. Pads come in different sizes for mild to severe incontinence. If the condition worsens, protective underwear can be used. These undergarments are now available like regular underwear with elastic waistbands and are easy to put on and take off. For lighter leaks, underwear liners often work well and are the least intrusive.
Coping: Talk with your physician about products, or check out the options at your local pharmacy. Your physician can give you a referral to an occupational therapist who can evaluate what products would be best for your situation. Often people find it easier to accept wearing underwear liners or absorbent pads than protective underwear.
It’s not “giving up” to use a product. Using a product can help keep you maintain dignity and independence.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/living-incontinence-social-and-emotional-challenges/,Living with Incontinence: Social and Emotional Challenges,"Bowel (fecal) incontinence presents additional issues. There can be the issue of odor and the discomfort of having stool next to your body for any amount of time. There is the need to clean up after an accident, which might mean bathing or showering, and the problem of disposal of the underwear that is soiled. At some point you may not be able to handle these tasks independently, relying on help from someone else. Paid help can often assist with these tasks easily, but a family member or partner taking care of the same task might have more difficulty. A negative reaction can leave you feeling ashamed and vulnerable. If help is needed in the middle of the night, not only is there a higher risk for falling, but also you might find yourself reluctant to wake your care partner to help. But not doing so is uncomfortable and not good for your skin. What is the best thing to do?
Coping: Again, talk openly with those directly involved about your and their discomfort can make it easier on everyone. It’s important for you to state that this loss of incontinence is not intentional. Using language that is appropriate can also raise the conversation to a more mature level, for example not using indirect terms such as “ca-ca,” or “diapers,” but rather directly discussing a bowel problem. You may want to talk with your physician along with a family member or care partner so everyone is on the same page.
Finally, know your options. Sometimes there is nothing that can be done, and sometimes there is. Have your physician do a complete health check-up to rule out a urinary tract infection, prostate problems, and other treatable conditions. If you take diuretic medicine such as Lasix, or other medication that causes frequent urges, look for a way to time taking your dose to maximize the time when you don’t have to be close to a bathroom. Exercise generally helps overall and specific exercises such Kegels are designed to help—but be sure to check with your doctor for what will work best for your specific condition. Alcoholic beverages and caffeine will cause you to urinate more. Consider limiting or timing your intake of coffee, black or green tea, some soft drinks, energy drinks, and over-the-counter medications that include caffeine. Tomato and spicy foods, as well as citrus fruits and drinks, can be irritating to the bladder. 
Keeping in mind that you are not less of a person because of incontinence helps you to maintain your sense of self. Recognize that you are not your health condition. Retaining a sense of acceptance and yes, even a sense of humor, may be your best defense to leading a more stress-free and satisfying life.",[]

Also called a Living Trust.
You name a trustee to oversee the trust both while you are alive and to distribute the trust to beneficiaries when you die.
You may be the trustee of the trust while you are alive, in which case you name a successor trustee for the trust who will manage it after you die or become incapacitated.
A revocable trust allows you to control everything that happens in the trust while you are alive.
An irrevocable trust cannot be changed without the beneficiary’s consent.
There are many options for trusts for specific purposes, such as:
Special needs trust: Puts money aside to help someone who is disabled
Charitable trust: Money given to a charity
Bypass trust: Irrevocable trust passes assets to the spouse and then the children at death of second parent, limiting estate taxes
Life insurance trust: Removes life insurance from estate and thus estate taxes

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/medications-double-edged-sword/,Medications: A double-edged sword,"“Any symptom in an elderly patient should be considered a drug side effect until proved otherwise.”
Brown University
Long-term Care Quality Letter, 1995.
Modern medicines have contributed to longer life spans, improved health and better quality of life. Medications are the most common treatment for many diseases and conditions seen in older people and persons with disabilities. Medicines now not only treat and cure diseases that were untreatable just a few years ago, they aid in the early diagnosis of disease; prevent life-threatening illnesses; relieve pain and suffering; and allow people with terminal illnesses to live more comfortably during their last days.
However, for older adults and people with disabilities, medications—prescription, over-the-counter, social drugs such as alcohol, and herbal remedies/alternative medicines—can be a double-edged sword. When not used appropriately, effectively and safely, medications can have devastating consequences.
The changes that occur with aging and disability make people more likely to suffer medication-related problems (MRPs). Nevertheless, research has shown that medication-related problems are often preventable. Caregivers can play a key role in helping to identify when an actual or potential MRP is occurring. This assistance can help prevent the costly and unwanted negative consequences of medication use, such as admission to acute care hospitals, assisted living facilities or nursing homes. About one quarter of all nursing home admissions are due at least in part to the inability to take medication correctly.
Research has shown that a high percentage of caregivers help their friends or relatives manage medications. Caregivers for people with Alzheimer’s disease and other memory impairments commonly report problems with getting their relative or friend to take medications on time, in the right amount, and as directed. In surveys, caregivers often report that their knowledge of their loved one’s medications—intended uses, directions for use, side effects, possible interactions—is greater than that of the care recipients themselves.
When patients, caregivers, doctors and pharmacists function as a team, medication-related problems can be avoided, contributing to better outcomes and improved daily functioning.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/medications-double-edged-sword/,Medications: A double-edged sword,"Older adults, people with disabilities and caregivers may encounter challenges when taking medications. Resolving these problems can lead to much better results from medicines. Consumers and caregivers must alert their doctors and pharmacists to any difficulties they have taking medications, including the following:
Memory: Difficulty remembering to take medications. The pharmacist can provide a variety of special pill boxes or other aids that remind a caregiver and senior to take medications. The devices range from low-tech, such as simple containers with compartments labeled for meals and bedtime, to high-tech, such as containers that beep when it’s time for a dose, or a special bottle cap that counts openings of a prescription bottle to tell if the day’s doses have been taken. For those with severe memory impairments, caregivers are key to the proper administration of all medicines. In addition, some aging-related service organizations offer medication reminder telephone calls for older persons with memory problems.
Vision: Difficulty reading labels on prescription labels and over-the-counter products. Pharmacists may be able to provide prescription labels in large print. Health care providers and caregivers can read the information on over-the-counter products for consumers with vision impairment. Magnifying glasses may also be helpful.
Hearing: Difficulty hearing instructions from health care professionals. Ask doctors, nurses, and pharmacists to speak louder and/or write down important information relevant to the safe use of medications. Caregivers can also be “the ears” for seniors with hearing impairments.
Dexterity: Difficulty opening bottles, inability to break tablets, problems handling medicines such as eye drops, inhalers for asthma and other lung disease, and insulin injections. These problems are common for people with arthritis and certain types of disabilities. Large, easy-open bottle tops are available for prescription medicines. If a prescription dose is one-half tablet, the pharmacist can split the tablets for you. Caregivers are key to assisting with the administration of eye drops, inhaled medications, injections, and other dosage forms that require fine motor skills. Again, pharmacies can provide instruction sheets on administration of medicines.
Swallowing: Difficulty swallowing tablets or capsules. Many prescription and over-the-counter products are available in a variety of dosage forms such as a liquid, skin patch, or suppository, greatly reducing difficulties associated with swallowing. Ask your pharmacist about alternative dosage forms.
Scheduling logistics: Scheduling many different medications throughout the day. One of the greatest challenges for older persons and caregivers is working medication schedules into daily routines. Special pill boxes and other aids, described above, can help. It’s essential that older people and caregivers devise a plan for medication administration that fits their daily schedule. For example, meal times or bedtimes can be used as cues for scheduling medication if mealtimes and bedtimes are regularly scheduled. Doctors and pharmacists can assist in developing a plan to best suit your daily schedule.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/mild-cognitive-impairment-mci/,Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI),"We know that some memory loss is associated with getting older. We forget someone’s name, where we put the keys, the date. But if memory loss is becoming troublesome, and you notice that it’s happening more and more, you may have what’s known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
This fact sheet provides information about MCI, practical tips for coping with its effects, and suggestions for how family members or friends can help.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/mild-cognitive-impairment-mci/,Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI),"Mild cognitive impairment is a condition that falls somewhere between normal age-related memory loss and Alzheimer’s disease or a similar impairment. Not everyone with MCI develops dementia. And like dementia, MCI is not an illness, but a cluster of symptoms that describes changes in how you think or process information. Memory problems are the most common indicators of MCI. A person with MCI may also experience difficulties with judgment, thinking, and language beyond what one might expect with normal aging. For unknown reasons, MCI appears to affect men more than women.
Family members and friends who notice these problems might not express concern because the early symptoms can mimic normal, age-related changes. People suffering from MCI often recognize they are having trouble but are still able to carry on most of their usual activities and live independently.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/mild-cognitive-impairment-mci/,Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI),"If you or your family members have increasing concerns about your mental abilities and memory, the cause could be MCI. If so, you will be experiencing some or all of the symptoms below:
More frequent difficulty remembering simple things
Difficulty following a conversation or basic instructions
Frequently losing your train of thought
Forgetting appointments or scheduled events
Feeling overwhelmed when you attempt to make plans or decisions
Losing your way even in familiar locations.
With MCI, these changes do not occur suddenly but worsen over time. In addition to these cognitive symptoms (or perhaps because of them), many people with MCI also experience secondary emotional symptoms such as depression, anxiety, irritability, or apathy.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/mild-cognitive-impairment-mci/,Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI),"The causes of MCI are not clear, but it appears that some of the same risks for Alzheimer’s disease are risks for MCI. Those risks include:
Being 65 or older
Having a family history of MCI, Alzheimer’s disease, or another form of dementia
Having certain medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, high cholesterol, or heart disease
Substance abuse, including alcohol abuse
Lack of exercise
Brain imaging and medical research have shown that some people with MCI also have the plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and shrinkage in the memory center of the brain that is observed in those with Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Other problems (which may be reversible) can contribute to memory loss, including medication interactions (from both presciption and over-the-counter drugs), infections, vitamin shortages, malnutrition, thyroid and other metabolic disturbances, depression, and drug/alcohol abuse.
It’s important to note that some people with MCI never get worse, and do not develop Alzheimer’s. Current studies find that approximately half of the people diagnosed with MCI will experience continued progression of the symptoms, leading to a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or a similar dementia.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/mild-cognitive-impairment-mci/,Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI),"There is no single, specific test to indicate the presence of MCI. A full evaluation is necessary to diagnose MCI and/or rule out other potential causes of the symptoms.
This thorough evaluation, similar to that for Alzheimer’s disease, includes a physical examination, neurological examinations, laboratory tests, neuropsychological and memory tests, review of medical history and medications, and clinical observations. The experiences of the patient and close friends or family members are also important to the evaluation process.
Just as there is no single definitive test, there is no specific treatment or cure for MCI. Some doctors recommend taking medications currently prescribed for early-stage or moderate Alzheimer’s disease to try to maintain cognitive abilities with MCI, but research studies have not provided clear-cut evidence on the benefits. However, new medications are being developed and studied and may be approved by the FDA. They may be restricted to people in early stages of dementia or only available for those participating in clinical trials. A neurologist can help determine if these are appropriate and to evaluate the risks and benefits.
Mental stimulation and physical exercise keep your mind and body functioning well. Health professionals theorize that what’s good for the heart is also good for the brain. One study suggests that simply walking five to six miles per week helps retain cognitive abilities or even slows down the progression of MCI.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/mild-cognitive-impairment-mci/,Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI),"Mild cognitive impairment can make you feel frustrated. To cope with the frustration, try some of the techniques listed below to help compensate for any memory decline that interferes with your enjoyment of life, your effectiveness at work, your relationships, and your goals for the future.
Be patient with yourself and ask your family to be patient with you. Understand that you may feel frustrated, anxious, or sad at the loss of some abilities. Slowing down can sometimes make it easier to remember or complete a task.
Learn more about MCI and share that knowledge with those around you. This will enable them to bet­ter understand the changes that are affecting you.
Discuss with a family member, or other trusted person, your preferences for decisions affecting your life, should the MCI progress to dementia. (For more information on discussing your preferences, see the FCA Fact Sheets Making Choices About Everyday Care and Legal Issues in Planning for Incapacity, listed under the Resources section of this fact sheet.)
Find constructive ways to release anger and frustration you may feel. Exercise, talk with a close friend or a counselor, and consider joining a support group for people with memory loss. (The Alzheimer’s Association has support groups for people with early stage Alzheimer’s disease, including people with an MCI diagnosis.) It will help to talk to others going through the same experience, or one that is similar. Encourage your family members to seek out counseling and support to meet their needs.
Continue to explore ways to fulfill your needs for intimacy and closeness. Participate in family events as you are able, and keep in touch with friends. The desire for close relationships with others continues throughout life.
Ask your physician for an exercise program that best fits your needs. Exercise contributes to good physical health, can reduce stress, and helps keep your brain as healthy as possible.
Use visible and/or accessible reminders. Useful strategies include writing notes to yourself, posting a large calendar to track appointments, leaving messages to yourself on your answering machine, using an automatic dispensing pill box, and setting the alarm on a mobile device to remind you of upcoming events.
Document your personal story by creating a scrapbook, recording your autobiography, or keeping a journal. This is a wonderful way to reflect upon your life and share yourself with those close to you. Your children and grandchildren will treasure these keepsakes.
Keep your mind active doing things that you enjoy: Work on puzzles, read the newspaper, play cards, listen to music, write in a journal, learn about something new.
Know that you are more than someone with MCI. Celebrate the many and varied personal attributes that you possess.
Increase your awareness of MCI research projects and clinical trials of new medications. Participate in medication trials if your physician thinks they might be helpful.
Become an advocate for yourself and other individuals with MCI. Write letters and make phone calls to local and state representatives, and assist community agencies in training staff and professionals about MCI.
Complete an Advance Healthcare Directive, a Durable Power of Attorney, and Durable Power of Attorney for Finances. These documents will help your loved ones provide you with the type of care you want and need in the future should you be unable to state those preferences. Meet with a lawyer knowledgeable about estate planning to draft a will, set up a trust, or handle other related legal matters.
Focus on your present abilities and avoid worrying about what might happen in the future. Know that there are many ways to live an active and productive life. Focus on what you can do, not on what you can’t.
Here are some additional tips to help you enhance your memory, health, and well-being:
Take good care of your body. Keep hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Eat a low-fat, healthy diet, with plenty of fruits and vegetables.
Maintain an updated list of your medications and contact information (doctors and family). Keep it with you at all times.
Reduce clutter at home; enlist a friend to help organize and label important files, documents, and medications.
Decrease your consumption of alcohol; it can have a negative effect on your mental abilities.
Don’t smoke.
Continue to engage in social activities with friends and family.
Never stop learning. Read a book, enroll in a class, attend a concert or play.
Talk with friends or a trained counselor about your feelings.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/mild-cognitive-impairment-mci/,Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI),"It may be necessary to change your daily routine due to MCI. Although a time may come when you must rely more on others for assistance with some tasks, you will want to stay involved in making decisions that affect your life. The goal is to find a balance in your life: ensuring your safety while maintaining a reasonable degree of independence.
The following may require adjustments in your life:
Driving: If you drive, ongoing evaluation of your driving abilities and consultation with your physician are essential. It’s also wise to pay attention to the suggestions of those close to you, as they might recognize changes in your driving ability before you do. AARP offers driving classes and evaluations of driving ability.
Home responsibilities: Household management may be difficult for you. Tasks such as cooking and taking medications may pose safety risks. You might, for example, forget to turn off the stove or forget to take a dose of medication. However, it’s possible to continue to participate in household activities with a little help from another person or with the aid of technology (electronic medication reminders, etc.). You might choose to have family or friends assist in certain areas, or you might hire outside help. This is a good time to start discussing options with those close to you should you no longer be able to manage these tasks in the future.
Financial responsibilities: Complex tasks like balancing a checkbook, dealing with insurance, and paying bills may become frustrating and overwhelming. Consider enlisting a trusted family member or friend to help. Work with an attorney to draw up a Power of Attorney for Finances. This will allow a trusted person to act on your behalf if you aren’t able to do so. Be sure to include this person early in the process so that he or she has time to learn what needs to be done. Like driving, managing your own finances is a sign of independence. It can be difficult to allow someone else to do this for you, but there is no embarrassment in admitting you need help. The people who are close to you may recognize your need for help before you do.
Health care: Complete an Advance Health Care Directive (sometimes known as a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care or a Living Will), to ensure that your family members know your health care choices. It is important to have a conversation about end-of-life care as well, and to complete the appropriate forms documenting your preferences.",dementia

A new diagnosis of MCI for yourself or a loved one can be difficult to accept. As you learn more about this condition, we encourage you to keep an open mind and remember that you are not alone. Speaking with other people who have had similar experiences can be immensely helpful. Organizations that provide assistance and support are located in communities all across the nation, and many websites offer information and opportunities for interaction with others in the same situation. Reaching out for help and support can make all the difference.
Alzheimer’s, senior service, and health organizations: Several organizations, both local and national, help people with cognitive impairment or dementia and their family caregivers. Many offer support groups, advice lines, and services at no cost to you. See the Resources list at the end of this fact sheet for specific contact information.
Support groups and counseling services: Support groups for those with memory loss can be primarily discussion-oriented or can offer a variety of creative activities including planned outings. Caregiver support groups and education programs are also available in the community for family members or friends who are assisting you.
Volunteer programs: Volunteer opportunities for persons with MCI are available in some areas. You may enjoy the chance to contribute your time and talent to your community.
Artistic programs: Expressing yourself through drawing, painting, clay, or photography, for example, can be beneficial and provide you wonderful opportunities for self-expression.
Structured day programs: Adult day programs include activities such as art, music, gardening, exercise, discussion groups, field trips, and assistance with physical health needs.
Professional assistance: Take advantage of professionals who assist with maintaining your physical strength and coordination, such as personal trainers, occupational therapists, and physical therapists. Hired attendants can also help with household chores and errands.
Legal and financial assistance: Again, drawing up an Advanced Health Care Directive and a Durable Power of Attorney for Finances are essential first steps. The Area Agency on Aging has a listing of free and low-cost legal services for seniors in your community. For more information, see FCA’s Fact Sheet Legal Planning for Incapacity.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-caregivers-you-are-not-alone-article/,Multiple Sclerosis Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"In this article we will talk about useful tools to help you be prepared to care for an adult living with Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, and strategies to help you cope. It is based on the video “Multiple Sclerosis Caregivers: You’re Not Alone.” You may not always feel prepared for this role as a partner and caregiver for an individual living with MS but know that there are many skilled professionals and MS caregivers to help you.
This article has two sections. In the first, Everyday Living, we’ll highlight what every caregiver of a person diagnosed with MS may experience. The second section, Advanced Care, speaks to the caregiver when the person they care for needs substantial help with activities of daily living, such as bathing, eating, medication management and more. Those diagnosed with a progressive form of MS may experience the need for Advanced Care sooner than those with other types of MS.
Let’s start with a brief overview of MS. MS can occur in both adults and children. MS is a lifelong, unpredictable, autoimmune disease that causes lesions in the brain and spinal cord. MS occurs when the immune system attacks nerve fibers and myelin, the protective fatty covering of our nerves, causing inflammation. The resulting scar tissue blocks electrical signals to the brain disrupting normal body movement and function.
MS can cause various symptoms including:
vision loss
pain
fatigue
trouble with coordination and movement.
These symptoms will not only differ from person-to-person, but they can also range in severity and duration. Some may live symptom-free most of their lives, while others must navigate severe symptoms that never go away.
Currently MS remains a diagnosis of exclusion, where other potential causes of symptoms are ruled out before an MS diagnosis is made.
Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS): It is estimated that of those diagnosed with MS, over 80% have the Relapsing-Remitting type. In this form, MS “attacks,” which are a flare-up of disease symptoms, may occur every so often amid periods of relief. It can be weeks or even years between episodes.
Secondary Progressive MS: Overtime, the RRMS type can turn into a secondary progressive form of MS, where the disease advances at a slow, steady, unrelenting pace. This can occur more often for those who are not benefiting from treatment.
Primary Progressive MS: About 10% of individuals are diagnosed with a primary progressive form of MS where the disease worsens over time without periods of relief.
Please visit the National Multiple Sclerosis Society website for more details about the types of MS.
While there is no cure for MS yet, it’s not considered a fatal disease, and people diagnosed with MS may have the same life expectancy as the general public. Longevity can depend on the type of MS diagnosed and the type of treatment that is being received.
Research is underway to find innovative approaches to treat MS. Findings suggest medications can have the most impact if taken as soon as the disease is diagnosed.",multiple-sclerosis
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-caregivers-you-are-not-alone-article/,Multiple Sclerosis Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"As a caregiver, it is important to learn about MS. Helping an individual living with MS can be confusing.
You may have questions about how to adjust to and cope with the diagnosis, such as:
What is the type of MS diagnosed?
What is the typical course for this type of MS?
In what ways might MS affect the diagnosed individual, you the caregiver, and your family over time?
It’s important that you seek out information and professionals to help to answer any questions that you may have. For example:
People living with MS will benefit from a healthcare team comprised of a Primary Care Doctor, a Neurologist, and a Nurse.
At times, you might find it beneficial to also get help from a Social Worker, Physical Therapist, Occupational Therapist or Registered Dietitian.
To locate a doctor, visit the Find Doctors & Resources tool on the National Multiple Sclerosis Society website.
The Veterans Health Administration also has an established network of Multiple Sclerosis Centers of Excellence to optimize the care of veterans across the nation.
Although some people with MS will decide to solely follow standard medical management of the disease, a growing body of research is showing that also pursuing lifestyle changes can impact the course of the disease. Medication, in addition to modifying one’s diet and health habits, can have a positive impact on managing MS symptoms and any disease progression.
As a caregiver, you can join the person with MS by cooking and eating healthy meals, walking outdoors together, creating an environment to get adequate sleep, and seeking counseling for mental health support.
Fatigue, a common symptom of MS, can make doing things together challenging. For example, while you or I might feel re-energized after a good night’s sleep, a person with MS may wake-up still feeling exhausted. Don’t let this be a barrier. Instead seek out ways to build in rest periods throughout the day so that you can both enjoy your time together.",multiple-sclerosis
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-caregivers-you-are-not-alone-article/,Multiple Sclerosis Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"How are you feeling about your loved one’s diagnosis? Sadness, anger, fear, disbelief? Perhaps you feel relief at having an explanation for the unusual changes you’ve been observing? All of these feelings are normal.
When the person with MS is struggling physically or emotionally, you may find yourself torn between wanting to assist them to make things easier or waiting for the person to navigate the problem on their own or ask for your help.
Being available to talk with the person you care for about fears related to the disease, and providing assurance that you are in this together, can go a long way towards making everyone feel more comfortable and confident moving forward.
As changes occur, it is common to feel grief about witnessing deterioration in physical and mental functions. This can be felt by both you and the person you care for throughout the course of MS. Although there is no one right way to deal with the grief you may be feeling, there are healthy ways to deal with the impact it has on your relationship and on your life plans.
Many caregivers find journaling to be a useful way to document their feelings. Writing down your thoughts can help raise questions, fears, and new ways of doing things. Physical exercise, prayer, meditation, relaxation exercises, support groups, and talking one-on-one with a friend or counselor can help you stay well. Finding ways to reduce stress is a priority for MS caregivers. Take time to do things you find fun and fulfilling.
MS affects everyone in the family in different ways. This includes you as the caregiver, the person with MS, relatives, and friends. Each will require their own kind of support.
As MS advances, or a major relapse is experienced, it is common for caregivers to feel especially isolated and overwhelmed. Too often, just when you need more support, friends and even family may stay away due to their inability to witness your pain and that of the person you care for. They may not understand the disease or how they can help.
If you’re feeling anxious or angry, know that these emotions are hard to deal with on your own. Consider talking with your doctor or a counselor. Caregiver support groups can offer a safe environment to share your experiences and learn from others in similar situations. Support groups are usually free and can be online and or in-person. The National MS Society website contains links to support groups, online MS Communities, and other support professionals and services for people with MS and their caregivers.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-caregivers-you-are-not-alone-article/,Multiple Sclerosis Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"A common question caregivers ask is “What will happen to the person I care for if something happens to me?” One action that you can take is to make sure that your own legal and financial documents are updated. Encourage the person you care for to create or update their legal and financial documents too. As appropriate, you may speak with an attorney who specializes in disability law and estate planning.
Key documents to complete include:
Durable power of attorney for finances
Advance Health Care Directive
Will and/or trust
POLST form
DNR, for end-of-life medical interventions.
When discussing advanced healthcare preferences, it is also a good time to talk with the person about signing a release of information to allow medical staff to speak with you and others who may be actively involved in caregiving.
If you or the person with MS is employed, it is important to contact the employer’s Human Resources department to learn about eligible benefits, such as long-term disability and family leave options, both paid and unpaid.
Depending on the type of MS and the predicted disability, now may be the right time to investigate how to secure disability benefits. Securing financial help from the government can be a challenging and confusing process. We recommend seeking out experts to help you early on. Consult with an attorney or other professional who specializes in Social Security Disability Insurance, or SSDI, and Supplemental Security Income, or SSI. They can also help you navigate Medicare and Medicaid.
If the person you care for is a veteran, applying for benefits and enrolling in the VA health care system should be done as soon as possible. Your local Veterans Service Organization can offer guidance.
A person is eligible for Medicare when they turn 65 or if they become disabled before 65 and have been receiving SSDI for 24 months. It’s important to remember that Medicare does not pay for long-term care, such as care provided in an assisted living or skilled nursing facility or for private care at home
Long-term care insurance may be available even after receiving an MS diagnosis. Start by checking with Department of Insurance in your state.",multiple-sclerosis
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-caregivers-you-are-not-alone-article/,Multiple Sclerosis Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"Take some time for yourself. Respite can come from having a family member, friend, or in-home care professional allow you time to rest and replenish your energy. You can also create self-care moments throughout the day by taking small, intentional breaks for yourself, even if it’s just 15 minutes to drink a cup of tea, exercise, or engage in another enjoyable activity of your choice. Call a friend to meet for coffee or join you for a nature hike.
If you need more time-off and the person you care for needs more assistance than what a friend or aide can provide, there are out-of-home respite options, like adult day programs or short-term stays in a care residence.
Too often caregivers don’t feel they need a break until they experience a crisis or problem with their own health. We encourage you to seek respite early and as often as you need it.
Some signs that you need a break include:
A persistent ache or rash that doesn’t go away.
Your blood pressure is rising.
A health condition you have worsens.
You have trouble sleeping.
You’re feeling anxious, irritable and less patient.
You’re turning to alcohol or drugs in an effort to relieve your stress.
Remember, if the individual with MS needs an increasing amount of care, it’s easy to put-off your own healthcare needs. Be sure to also take care of your physical and emotional well-being! Keep your doctor or therapist appointments, visit with friends, and do activities you enjoy. Self-care benefits both you and the person you care for.
It may cause you anxiety to take time for yourself because you worry something bad will happen, or you feel guilty doing it. However, it’s essential to confront these concerns and make time to step outside of the caregiver role.",multiple-sclerosis

A person diagnosed with a progressive form of MS may lose a significant degree of balance and mobility and will need help with basic personal care, such as bathing, using the bathroom and dressing.
With Relapsing-Remitting MS a person may need help during a major relapse or attack, but then can recover to near or full-normalcy.
A Physical Therapist can do an assessment and suggest modifications, such as installing bathroom grab-bars for getting in and out of the shower.
An Occupational Therapist can help identify ways to manage daily activities such as cooking and eating. They also have an extensive knowledge about assistive devices.
For safety outside of the home, consider recommending that the individual with MS carry identification – a card or ID bracelet – identifying that they have MS and who to contact in an emergency.",multiple-sclerosis

But what does that mean to have someone come to your home “to help”? Find out more about how this option might work for you in the Family Caregiver Alliance fact sheet.
If the individual with MS begins to experience problems with cognition (or thinking), reasoning, or remembering, a neurologist can perform a brief screening to identify what might be causing the problem. The doctor may recommend a neuropsychologist to perform a more complete cognitive evaluation and assist with rehabilitation and helpful coping strategies. In some cases, depression, side effects from medications and even interactions between medications, can mimic cognitive problems and can be treated.
A registered dietitian can provide guidance on nutrition to help prevent or manage issues often associated with MS, such as fatigue and weight gain.
Palliative care is a type of supportive healthcare to improve the quality of life for people with chronic conditions. Palliative care teams can help a person to manage symptoms and reduce suffering. A person does not have to be on hospice to qualify.
A person living with a progressive form of MS will eventually need constant help with personal care and daily living activities. Talk with the medical team about medications, assistive devices, and other interventions to help enhance functioning and mobility.",multiple-sclerosis

Moving the person to a full-time skilled care facility can be a tough decision, but a necessary one. You may feel like you’ve failed or that you’re breaking a promise – even when you know placement will provide more safety and needed care than what you can provide.
It is helpful to get a list of local residences that you can visit. You can check Medicare.gov for ratings of skilled nursing facilities.
Even when the person moves to a care residence, your role as a caregiver does not end. Your ongoing presence and advocacy will help ensure that proper care is provided.",multiple-sclerosis

Care can be provided wherever the person resides – at home or in a care residence. Hospice includes visiting nurses, pain management, and personal care. Hospice may also provide spiritual, grief, and bereavement support as well as respite for family caregivers.
Hospice is a Medicare benefit and individuals are eligible when a doctor has determined a patient has 6 months or less to live. You can ask the doctor for a referral to begin services, or hospice can assist you in getting a referral from the doctor if the individual is eligible.",multiple-sclerosis

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-ms/,Multiple Sclerosis (MS),"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS)—the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. MS is thought to be caused by an immune-mediated disorder where the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in the CNS.
Nearly 1 million people nationwide, and more than 2.3 million people worldwide, are living with an MS diagnosis. Nearly anyone at any age may develop MS, but researchers have observed patterns:
Onset is most likely to occur between the ages of 20 and 50.
Women are three times as likely as men to develop MS.
The disease is also more common in regions with moderate climates and in people of northern European descent, though it can be seen in individuals of all ethnicities.
MS is not contagious. It is not directly inherited, but studies indicate that there are genetic and environmental factors that may make certain people more susceptible to it.
MS is unpredictable. From the type of symptoms, to their severity, to the progression of the disease itself, experiences with MS can vary greatly from patient to patient, as well as in the same patient over time.",multiple-sclerosis
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-ms/,Multiple Sclerosis (MS),"MS disrupts connections between the brain and spinal cord from the rest of the body. For example, when a healthy body experiences a sensation – touching something hot – our nerves send a signal to the brain with this information. The brain evaluates the information and communicates back to the nerve the way in which our body should respond to that stimulus. An individual with MS may not be able to feel this sensation fully due to injury to the CNS.
With MS, the immune system causes inflammation that damages the CNS’s myelin — the tissue that acts as insulation for nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. The disease also damages the nerve fibers themselves, as well as the cells that make myelin.
Damage to myelin or nerve fibers alters nerve impulses – what the body and brain depend on to communicate. Damaged myelin or nerve fibers can change how messages are sent and received throughout the nervous system.
The damage causes scar tissue, which gives the disease its name – multiple areas of scarring or multiple sclerosis.
Depending on the site of inflammation, these blockages can result in some of the symptoms of MS, which may include blurred vision, loss of balance, poor coordination, slurred speech, tremors, numbness and extreme fatigue. Individuals with MS may experience some, all, or none of these symptoms – it’s different for each person.",multiple-sclerosis
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-ms/,Multiple Sclerosis (MS),"Common symptoms include:
Fatigue. Mild to severe tiredness that can make it hard to function at home or work. 80% of people experience it, and it may be the most prominent symptom even in someone who has few other symptoms.
Vision problems.  Vision changes are often one of the first symptoms of MS. The optic nerve is a common area for inflammation. Because it is responsible for carrying vision signals to the brain, visual disturbances are common. They range from haziness and blurred vision to more serious visual impairment. Often, visual symptoms lessen or disappear after a period of weeks, upon remission. Blindness in MS is rare.
Weakness. Caused by nerve damage and unused muscles.
Spasticity. Stiffness and involuntary muscle spasms.
Movement. Difficulty in controlling the strength and precision of movements, so that holding things is a problem; balance and coordination may be impaired (also called ataxia).
Sensory. Numbness, tingling and sensitivity to heat or cold.
Pain and itching.
Dizziness. Sometimes this is a feeling of lightheadedness, unsteadiness or being off balance. Other times it may be vertigo (a sensation that the room is spinning).
Bladder and bowel problems. Bladder control, urinary tract infections, and constipation.  
Sexual problems. Can be due to nerve damage, fatigue, spasticity, or psychological factors.
Cognitive changes. Learning and processing information, problem solving, organization, and focus can all be affected.
Clinical depression. The most severe type of depression is one of the most common MS symptoms.
Emotional changes. Mood swings, irritability, uncontrollable laughing or crying.
Walking (gait). Resulting from the combined effects of other symptoms, such as weakness, spasticity, balance issues, fatigue.",multiple-sclerosis
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-ms/,Multiple Sclerosis (MS),"There is no single test available to clearly identify MS. Diagnosis of MS includes a thorough medical history, a neurologic exam, and tests such as bloodwork, spinal fluid analysis, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). MRI aids in diagnosis by producing a picture of the brain or spinal cord to show areas of inflammation and scarring that are typical with MS. Alternative diagnoses must also be excluded.
Diagnosing MS can be challenging and often takes time, so it’s wise to schedule an appointment with the primary care physician as soon as possible. Once diagnosed, the disease management can begin, which includes treatment that may slow progression of the disease.",multiple-sclerosis
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-ms/,Multiple Sclerosis (MS),"While no known cure for MS exists, it is not a fatal disease, and people diagnosed with MS have the same life expectancy as the general public.
According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (part of the National Institutes of Health), the vast majority of people with MS are mildly affected. In the worst cases, however, MS can render a person unable to write, speak, or walk. 
It is often difficult to predict the course of MS because it varies so much from person to person. Current research focuses on identifying more precise indicators of disease activity.
Managing the disease is key. This includes managing relapses, symptoms, medical therapies, physical therapies, alternative medicine, and other treatments.",multiple-sclerosis

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-ms/,Multiple Sclerosis (MS),"Much research is being conducted to find new approaches to the treatment of MS. Since there is no “cure,” treatment tends to center on remission, or stopping the attacks from occurring. Treatment focuses on:
Helping to bring about remission of symptoms
Lengthening the remission period so that the flare-ups are less likely to occur
Changing the course of the disease so progression slows
Providing symptom relief
Clinical research suggests medications can have the most impact if they are taken as soon as the disease is diagnosed. Stabilization of a patient’s symptoms as well as MRI imaging that shows a lack of active inflammation in the CNS are markers of effective therapy.",multiple-sclerosis
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-ms/,Multiple Sclerosis (MS),"For treating MS and its symptoms, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved numerous medications that have shown in clinical trials to reduce the number of relapses, delay progression of disability, and limit new disease activity (as seen on MRI). Treatments continue to evolve as medications are developed.
Additionally, specific medications are prescribed to help improve recovery time from relapses. For example, corticosteroids shorten the duration of relapses and help speed up recovery from a relapse. Effectiveness can vary from individual to individual, however. And due to well-documented side effects, corticosteroids cannot be used on an ongoing basis.
Lastly, there are medications used that can help treat the chronic symptoms of MS that do not alter the disease course. These medications are often used in other neurologic conditions. One example is anti-spasticity drugs, which are often effective in relieving muscle spasms.",multiple-sclerosis
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-ms/,Multiple Sclerosis (MS),"Depending on the therapy recommended by the physician, medications may be administered orally, or by infusion or injection. Some caregivers and individuals with MS may find it difficult to administer medications by injection and may be less likely to stay on a medication schedule.
Also, it is important to bear in mind that many MS medications can have significant side effects.
Be sure to consider method of delivery and side effects when selecting a medical intervention program that works for you and your loved one.",multiple-sclerosis
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-ms/,Multiple Sclerosis (MS),"Checking with organizations that specialize in MS (see resource list) is a good way to keep up to date on new drugs to treat MS, upcoming clinical trials and recent FDA drug approvals.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-ms/,Multiple Sclerosis (MS),"Medication is not the only way to manage the symptoms of MS.
Catheter management programs may benefit people experiencing urinary distress. A neurologist or urologist can help determine if this option is suitable.
Physical therapy or rehabilitation programs can help increase muscle strength, improve walking ability, reduce pain, and relieve muscle spasms.
Strength training and exercise can be beneficial according to research. Results from clinical trials have suggested that individuals who lifted weights and exercised experienced less fatigue, greater immune function and decreased inflammation.
Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) encompasses a host of interventions and non-medical approaches, including food and diet, exercise, stress management, vitamin D, and cooling strategies, among others. Many people combine one or more CAMs with conventional medical treatment.",multiple-sclerosis

Only 10% of those who develop cognitive problems experience symptoms severe enough to interfere with daily activities.
Yet, it is important to remember that for the person experiencing MS, cognitive changes – whatever the severity – may be just as devastating as physical changes; perhaps even more so. Cognitive difficulties are common among people who have had the disease for a long time, but they also may appear early on, occasionally from the onset of MS.
Among those individuals affected by cognitive disturbance, the most common problems are:
Memory recall, particularly remembering recent events
Slowness in learning and processing new information
Difficulty with reasoning, such as analyzing a situation, making a plan and follow through
Poor judgment
Impaired verbal ability, such as slowed speech or difficulty coming up with a needed word during conversation
Cognitive problems associated with MS are not related to level of physical disability and can affect people with few physical symptoms of MS. In addition, cognitive problems can develop rapidly during a flare-up of the disease. In these cases, the cognitive problems can decrease as the disease moves into remission.",multiple-sclerosis
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-ms/,Multiple Sclerosis (MS),"It is important to note that cognitive impairment in MS bears little resemblance to the intellectual decline in Alzheimer’s disease. There are important differences between the two.

Cognitive impairment in MS is typically mild.
Cognitive impairment in MS may stabilize at any time.",multiple-sclerosis
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-ms/,Multiple Sclerosis (MS),"Individuals with MS and their families should be aware of potential cognitive problems. Recognizing and learning about certain impairments can reduce misunderstandings about a person’s apparent forgetfulness, carelessness or seeming indifference.
Through open communication, families can be supportive and help the person cope with the changes that they are experiencing. Understanding symptoms related to MS can also help to reduce fears about losing one’s abilities. Sometimes, it is helpful to start talking about cognitive and other changes that might occur as a result of MS before they happen, so the individual with MS and the family can be sensitive to and aware of potential changes.",multiple-sclerosis
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/multiple-sclerosis-ms/,Multiple Sclerosis (MS),"Discuss suspected cognitive impairment with the person’s doctor to explore possible causes or triggers.
In some cases, depression, side effects from medications and even interactions between medications can mimic cognitive problems and can be treated separately.
A neurologist can perform a brief evaluation to test for severe cognitive deficits. A neuropsychologist who has expertise in diagnosing and treating MS may be recommended to perform a more complete evaluation to test for subtle cognitive changes.
If cognitive problems are found, the neuropsychologist may assist individuals and their families in coping by working on rehabilitation and strategies to help with cognitive changes.
Strategies to help with cognitive issues may include memory aids or using memory tricks:
Writing down all appointments
Making check lists
Using visual images or rhymes to help remember

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parenting-your-elderly-parents/,“Parenting” Your Elderly Parents,"Mary, a 54-year old mother of two college-age children, has begun helping her mother Betsy with daily tasks and doctor’s appointments. She visits each morning to ensure that her mother has showered, gotten a good breakfast, and taken her morning medications. Since her mother’s recent diagnosis with beginning stages of dementia, Mary has noticed that Betsy is requiring more care every day. This is causing Mary to experience feelings of anger, sadness, and stress as she takes on the caregiving role that has traditionally been held by her own mother.
Growing up, your parents may have offered support, advice, discipline, and care. Whether you needed to know how to fix your bike, or were seeking advice on how to diaper your first child, your parents may have been a source of guidance. However, as parents age, a growing number of family caregivers are struggling in an unfamiliar role as parental figure to their own elderly parents. Suddenly, the tables have turned and determining to how accept and settle into this new dynamic can be challenging. There are a few steps that Mary, and the millions of family caregivers in similar situations, can take to help ease the rigors of “parenting” your own elderly parents.
Allow yourself to mourn the “loss” of your parent
Although they have not passed away, the person that you knew as your mother or father may be changing rapidly. It is okay to feel sad or angry about your relationship changing, and to allow yourself to mourn the loss of your previous relationship.
Maintain respect in your communications
Elderly parents may be stubborn as well as embarrassed that they require assistance from their children for what was once a simple task, like bathing or getting to the grocery store. While caregiving in and of itself can be stressful, it is imperative to talk to your parents respectfully, and ask them to do the same. Although it may be frustrating for Mary to explain to her mother why she has to take her blood pressure medication every day, doing so calmly and clearly may reduce the chance of hurt feelings and a harmed relationship.
Set boundaries in your caregiving duties
Regardless of how much you love your mother or father, neither of you may be comfortable with having to assist him or her with bathing or toileting. However, taking the time to establish boundaries of what you are capable of, and comfortable doing, will allow you to create a care plan for your parents with which all parties are confident. Remember, outside help, like that of a home care provider, can assist with tasks that are outside of your comfort zone.
Plan ahead to ensure security
Long-term care can drain a family’s financial resources. However, by taking time to plan ahead, children may still be able to talk with their parents about available resources in the estate to pay for care, as well as their desires for long-term care. A realistic plan may help you feel as though there is some roadmap for your parents’ future, as well as yours as a caregiver, and provide relative peace of mind in an otherwise unnerving situation. This FCA blog post, “Making Ends Meet When Money Is Tight,” may be helpful to you, as well as detailed information on financial and legal planning in our online fact sheet, Making End-of-Life Decisions: What Are Your Important Papers?.
Get support
Finding support as you transition into the role of caregiver is imperative to avoid harming your own mental and physical well-being. An overload of stress can quickly lead to medical conditions such as high blood pressure and depression, as well as overall feelings of anxiousness and fear. Support from siblings and friends and turning to online forums and local support groups are some healthy ways to cope. Transitioning from the role of child to parent is a major change in the parent-child relationship. Regardless of your previous relationship with your parents, it’s important to recognize your emotions about the transition and allow yourself to grieve in the process. With the proper support, planning, and patience, parenting your parents in their golden years can be a less stressful and a more rewarding experience.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregiving/,Parkinson’s Disease and Caregiving,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive, neurological disease that mainly affects movement but can also affect cognition. Parkinson’s disease results from the destruction of nerve cells in a part of the brain called the basal ganglia.
Different parts of the brain work together by sending signals to each other to coordinate all of our thoughts, movements, emotions, and senses. When we want to move, a signal is sent from the basal ganglia to the thalamus and then to the cerebral cortex, all different parts of the brain. Nerve cells in the brain communicate by using chemicals. A chemical (neurotransmitter) called dopamine is produced in a group of cells called the substantia nigra and is essential for normal movement. When the cells die, they can no longer produce and send dopamine, so the signal to move doesn’t get communicated. By the time a person starts to experience motor symptoms of Parkinson’s, they’ve already lost approximately 50% of their dopamine producing cells. People may experience non-motor symptoms from loss of other neurotransmitters up to ten years before motor symptoms are noticed.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregiving/,Parkinson’s Disease and Caregiving,"Caring for a loved one with PD can be a challenging job, especially as the disease progresses. Former caregivers of a loved one with PD suggest doing the following (see more about these at the end of this fact sheet): Get prepared, Take care of yourself, Get help (don’t try to do it all yourself), Work to maintain a good relationship with your loved one, and Encourage the person with PD for whom you care, to stay active.
Preparing for caregiving starts with education. Reading this fact sheet is a good start. More resources are available to you in the Resources section of this fact sheet. Early Parkinson’s disease (PD) usually requires more emotional support and less hands-on care. It is a good time for family members/caregivers to educate themselves about the disease.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregiving/,Parkinson’s Disease and Caregiving,"Parkinson’s disease, documented in 1817 by physician James Parkinson, is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease. Estimates regarding the number of people in the United States with Parkinson’s range from 500,000 to 1,500,000, with 50,000 to 60,000 new cases reported annually. No objective test for Parkinson’s disease exists, so the misdiagnosis rate can be high, especially when a professional who doesn’t regularly work with the disease makes the diagnosis.
Since Parkinson’s is more common in people 60 years old and older, it is expected that the incidence of Parkinson’s will increase with the aging of the baby boomers. Although PD is more common in older persons, some people do begin to experience symptoms before they are 40 years old. Researchers have identified families who experience an increased incidence of PD, with some showing a genetic relationship from known PD genes. However, genetic causes of Parkinson’s are rare, only in approximately 6–8% of all cases. Most people diagnosed with PD do not have family members with PD. Recent studies show there may be a genetic predisposition to developing PD, but environmental exposure to certain toxins (many years prior to symptoms) may be needed to develop the disease. One common expression is “genetics loads the gun, but environmental [exposure] pulls the trigger.” Epidemiological studies are actively exploring the relationship between Parkinson’s disease and exposure to agents such as herbicides, pesticides, and other toxins.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregiving/,Parkinson’s Disease and Caregiving,"All persons with Parkinson’s do not develop the same symptoms, and any symptoms that do develop may change over time as the disease progresses. People will experience both motor and non-motor symptoms. Typically PD motor symptoms start on one side of the body, and over time may progress to both sides. Often, one side is more affected than the other. The primary symptoms most commonly associated with Parkinson’s disease are:
Tremor: Not all persons with PD develop tremor, but this is a common symptom. The tremor is described as a “pill rolling” action of the hand/fingers, usually most pronounced at rest, and may lessen with action, or movement. Tremor often starts on one side of the body—usually with the hand—but may also involve the arms, feet, legs, and chin.
Rigidity or stiffness: In addition to making movement difficult, stiffness can also cause muscle aches. This symptom often is initially attributed to arthritis or pain syndromes, and persons often seek medical attention for “frozen shoulder” symptoms or “tennis elbow” and other orthopedic complaints.
Slow movement (bradykinesia), loss of movement (akinesia): Symptoms present with a decreased arm swing on one side, or decreased ability to perform usual motor tasks at usual speeds. Those affected can lose the ability to make normal facial expressions, appearing “mask-like” to the person they are talking with. Family and friends may comment that the person smiles less or appears disinterested when in fact they are unable to make the facial muscles move in ways to help express what they are feeling.
Balance and walking problems: Initially persons have difficulty walking at normal speeds or may find it difficult to fully lift a leg, causing the foot to “drag” behind the other foot. Or, they may take unusually small steps to move forward or use several tiny steps to turn around. Eventually postural problems result in a stooped torso with a noticeable shuffling gait. The resulting body imbalance can cause the person to stumble or experience near falls. The person may no longer instinctually reach their arm out to “break” their fall, putting them at greater risk for injury. Most people do not develop postural problems until many years after they have been diagnosed. Some individuals also experience episodes of “freezing” when they cannot move for several seconds or minutes. This is most common when they are approaching a doorway or other contained or small space.
Although there are no specific tests for Parkinson’s disease, there are several ways of making a diagnosis. Usually a diagnosis is based on a neurological exam that covers evaluation of the symptoms and their severity. If symptoms are serious enough, a trial test of anti-Parkinson’s drugs may be used. Brain scans may be made to rule out other diseases whose symptoms resemble Parkinson’s disease. At least two of the above primary symptoms are present when a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease is made.
According to the Hoehn and Yahr scale, a commonly used system for describing how the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease progress, Parkinson’s disease has the following stages:
Prodromal symptoms (those symptoms that may develop many years before diagnosis): Depression, anxiety, fatigue, disturbance of color vision, constipation, loss of smell acuity (hyposmia), problems with sleep, slowed thinking
Stage I: Motor symptoms on one side of the body
Stage II: Symptoms spread to both sides of the body
Stage III: Balance starts to become impaired
Stage IV: More difficulty with gait, freezing or small, fast steps. More problems that affect the center or midline of the body such as difficulty swallowing, balance, and increased non-motor problems
Stage V: Unable to locomote independently, becoming dependent on a wheelchair or other mobility device
Recent research has identified primary non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease that might be experienced up to 10 years before the motor symptoms appear. They are:
Constipation
Loss of olfaction (smell)/decreased acuity
Sleep disorders (trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, yelling out, or acting out one’s dreams)
Pain
Seborrhea (flakiness of skin around nose, forehead, chin)
Fatigue
Depression: Approximately 40% of people with PD develop depression, which can be treated with medication and/or counseling. It is important for people with PD and their caregivers to report signs of depression to the physician. Persons with PD may not acknowledge their depression, and resist taking medication to treat this symptom.
People with Parkinson’s can develop some of the following symptoms as the disease progresses:
Swallowing difficulties (usually a later symptom): At least 50% of people with Parkinson’s develop swallowing problems (dysphagia) that may cause the person to drool, to spill food or liquid from the mouth, or to send food to the back of the throat before it is ready to be swallowed. People with Parkinson’s and their caregivers should take care to watch for signs of choking due to food stuck in the throat, or increased congestion after eating. Due to difficulty coughing and clearing the lungs, people with Parkinson’s also run an increased risk of developing pneumonia. Swallowing problems can be helped with speech therapy.
Speech problems (usually a later symptom): An estimated 60% to 90% percent of people with Parkinson’s will develop some difficulty speaking. A person with PD may speak very softly and may be hard to understand (hypophonia). Speech impairment is referred to as dysarthria and is often characterized as weak, slow, or uncoordinated speaking that can affect volume and/or pitch. The voice may sound hoarse or come out in short bursts. Often, speech problems worsen over time. Speech problems can be helped with speech therapy.
Cognition issues (processing and using information): The majority of people diagnosed with PD will experience some degree of cognitive impairment that increases in severity over time. An individual may experience forgetfulness, distractibility, weakening executive functioning skills (problem solving, planning, multi-tasking), slower mental processing (recalling names, learning new information) and language and visual-spatial difficulties. All medications should be monitored, since high doses of some drugs used for Parkinson’s can cause cognitive impairment such as hallucinations or confusion.
Active diagnosis and treatment of the motor functions caused by Parkinson’s disease occur to a greater degree than do the diagnosis and treatment of life-impairing cognitive disease-related conditions. Often the family caregiver may notice cognition changes even before the care recipient may see them in him/herself. If you notice cognitive changes, it is valuable information to discuss with the care recipient and to share with their doctor. (See the Parkinson’s Disease Dementia section of this fact sheet for more information.)
Additional PD symptoms may include:
Restlessness/anxiety
Eyelid closure (dystonia of the eyelids can occur when a medication dose wears off)
Difficulty writing (small handwriting)
Urinary urgency and frequency (a later symptom: multiple trips to the bathroom, accidents)
Excessive sweating
Sexual problems (late symptom)",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregiving/,Parkinson’s Disease and Caregiving,"If the disease progresses beyond minor symptoms, drug treatment may be indicated. Drug therapy for Parkinson’s typically provides relief for 10–15 years or more. The most commonly prescribed medication is L-dopa (levodopa), and this helps replenish some of the depleted dopamine in the brain. Sinemet, a combination of levodopa and carbidopa, is the drug most doctors use to treat Parkinson’s disease. Recent clinical studies have suggested, in the younger person, the class of drugs called “dopamine agonists” (a compound that activates dopamine receptors in the absence of dopamine) should be used prior to levodopa-carpidopa (Sinemet) except in patients with cognitive problems or hallucinations. In those older than 75, dopamine agonists should be used cautiously because of an added risk of hallucinations.
Other drugs are also used, and new drugs are continually being tested. It is common for multiple drugs to be prescribed because many of them work well together to control symptoms and reduce side effects. Contrary to past beliefs, starting Sinemet in newly diagnosed people does not lead to early symptoms of dyskinesia (involuntary movements such as twitching or jerking). Current knowledge is that the disease progression causes dyskinesias, not a “resistance” to the drug.
Quality of life studies show that early treatment with dopaminergic medications improves daily functioning, prevents falls, and improves a person’s sense of well-being.
It is very important for people with PD and their family caregiver to work closely with their doctor(s) and to seek advice from a movement disorders specialist, who can best manage the more complicated aspects of the disease. Over time, physicians add combinations of drugs, and more frequent dosing is required as the disease progresses. In the more advanced stages, the Parkinson’s drugs provide a shorter time period when each dose is effective in controlling the symptoms. This shortened benefit from each dose is called “wearing off,” and the motor symptoms (and sometimes the non-motor symptoms, such as anxiety) return before the scheduled next dose. People with PD need to pay close attention to the times they take their medications and note the length of time the medication helps their symptoms and how long the medication effects last before wearing off. This information helps the physician better determine the amount of medication and the schedule for its use.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregiving/,Parkinson’s Disease and Caregiving,"As with all medications, side effects can be a problem. For some, starting Sinemet may cause dizziness or nausea. These symptoms may be most severe when the person first begins taking the drug and gradually disappear or lessen with time. Sometimes adding extra “carbidopa” with each tab of Sinemet helps control the nausea.
For other medications, side effects may appear after several years. For example, long-term levodopa use may result in large uncontrollable movements (dyskinesias) or “off” periods where the person becomes frozen (can’t move) until the next dose of medication is taken or a sensory trick is used (for example, counting out loud, like a march, “One, two, three.”) Another side effect in the more advanced stages and from larger doses of dopaminergic medications are visual hallucinations, where people at first see things in the corner of their visual field. Sometimes these hallucinations can be frightening.
There is a well-described side effect from dopamine agonists that everyone who starts this class of medication should know about. Agonists and higher doses of Sinemet may cause impulse control (behavioral) problems. These behaviors vary, but may include: excessive spending, gambling, sex, pornography, or hoarding behaviors. Often reducing or stopping this class of medications stops the behavior. These behaviors can be so embarrassing for the care recipient and their family that too often the topic is avoided when talking with the doctor. Odd as it may feel, keeping track of unusual impulse behavior to report to the neurologist can provide critical medical management information.
Sometimes, in the most advanced stages, a choice has to be made between motor function and cognitive function. High doses of medications may be required to manage the motor symptoms, but these same doses cause hallucinations or paranoia. At this point, a team meeting with all the medical providers and the family is advised to discuss the need to adjust the medications causing the side effects, yet balance the need to help the patient’s motor symptoms. Sometimes adding an anti-psychotic medication (such as quetiapine/Seroquel) is helpful. A multidisciplinary team meeting adds value and can help the family weigh the pros and cons of the PD medications with the caregiver and patient’s quality of life.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregiving/,Parkinson’s Disease and Caregiving,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment for Parkinson’s disease that uses an implantable pacemaker-like device to deliver electrical pulses to parts of the brain involved in movement. The DBS system consists of leads precisely inserted into a specific brain target, the neurostimulator (pacemaker) implanted in the chest, and extension wires that connect the leads to the neurostimulator. Though implantation of the system (DBS surgery) requires a neurosurgical procedure, the treatment itself consists of long-term electrical stimulation. Advantages of DBS include its ability to reduce the high doses of medications (avoiding the systemic side effects of medication), its adjustability (stimulation settings are programmed non-invasively using a wireless programmer by the clinician or a patient programmer), and its reversibility (can turn it on or off.) DBS was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for PD in 2002 and according to Medtronic (the manufacturer of the DBS system), more than 80,000 patients have undergone DBS surgery worldwide.
Typical candidates are those who have motor fluctuations or periods of “off” time with troublesome symptoms alternating with periods of “on” time with good symptom control, and also with possible periods of excessive movement (dyskinesia).
Not all patients with Parkinson’s disease are good candidates for treatment with DBS. Approximately 10–20% of patients considered for possible treatment with DBS include those:
With idiopathic (arising from unknown cause) Parkinson’s disease and not an atypical variety of parkinsonism
Who still respond, even if briefly during the day, to levodopa-containing medication
Who are significantly troubled by motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (slowness, stiffness, shaking, or other movement problems), despite taking an optimized regimen of medications
Who do not have significant problems with memory or other cognitive functions
Who do not have significant or untreated mental health issues, like depression or anxiety
Who have considered the likely benefits and potential risks of DBS and find this assessment acceptable for their situation
Have reasonable expectations for what DBS likely will and will not do for them
Individuals whose condition meets these criteria are advised to seek a comprehensive evaluation from an experienced DBS team. This may be accomplished by requesting a referral from the patient’s neurologist to a DBS center. The best candidates who have the most robust response to DBS tend to be younger than 70 years of age, with few center of the body symptoms such as swallowing and balance problems.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregiving/,Parkinson’s Disease and Caregiving,"Many caregivers and individuals with Parkinson’s disease are interested in complementary therapies to supplement medications and other traditional PD treatments. Increasingly, studies are showing that recreational physical activities such as walking, swimming, dance, yoga, and Tai Chi can play an important role for individuals living with Parkinson’s disease. Although there is no evidence that non-medical activities can affect disease progression, physical activity may assist with management of the symptoms of the disease while helping to increase enjoyment of life by staying active, having fun, and learning new skills. Innovative programs are increasingly available. For example, one popular program started in New York and replicated in other states and countries offers dance classes for individuals with PD. A San Francisco Bay Area Parkinson Group partnered with the Mark Morris Dance Group, a highly regarded modern dance company, to develop dance classes for persons with Parkinson’s disease, friends, and family. Professional dancers teach the classes in a large dance studio with live piano accompaniment (See the References section of this fact sheet for more information on these and other programs).
Consult your doctor and Parkinson’s care team regarding the type of movement you would like to pursue. They can recommend how hard you should be working (intensity) and the duration of the activity. A recommendation from your doctor to consult with a physical, occupational, or speech therapist is often useful. These professionals can assist you in evaluating how to use non-medical interventions in a way that best suits your needs.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregiving/,Parkinson’s Disease and Caregiving,"[LBD is an umbrella term for Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).]
Current research is helping to differentiate dementia related conditions in relationship to Parkinson’s disease. Doctor’s use a 12-month arbitrary rule to aid in diagnosis. When dementia is present before or within 1 year of Parkinson’s motor symptoms developing, an individual is diagnosed with DLB. Those who have an existing diagnosis of Parkinson’s for more than a year, and later develop dementia, are diagnosed with PDD.
In the simplest terms, Lewy bodies are abnormal clumps of proteins that develop in nerve cells. Cholinesterase inhibitors, medications originally developed for Alzheimer’s disease, are the standard treatment today for cognitive DLB and PDD symptoms. Early diagnosis is important, as DLB patients may respond differently than Alzheimer’s disease patients to certain drug, behavioral, and dementia care treatments.
Studies show that 10% to 70% of those living with PD will develop some degree of dementia (loss of brain function). This loss affects memory, thinking, language, judgment, and behavior. A few of the signs of dementia in PD include slowed thinking, a more passive (or apathetic) personality, memory problems, and trouble with decision-making. One particularly troubling symptom for a caregiver is when a care recipient experiences vivid hallucinations or delusions—seeing or hearing things that are not really present but seem very real to the individual. Frightening or dangerous hallucinations may call for a medical intervention. Use of certain antipsychotic medication can have highly debilitating side effects due to a hypersensitivity to these drugs by many LBD patients. Highly cautious use and careful monitoring by your doctor is critical should the use of these drugs become necessary. It’s also important to note that people living with LBD may or may not experience worsened hallucinations and delusions from medication used for PD, such as levodopa. An individual can also experience disease-induced episodes of paranoia and have sleep/wake cycle disruption.
This challenging, multi-system disorder involving movement, cognition, behavior, sleep, and autonomic function requires a comprehensive treatment approach to maximize the quality of life for both the care recipient and their caregiver. It is very important to pay attention to symptoms of dementia and to search for an expert clinician who can diagnose the condition accurately.
Depression, which is common in both PD and LBD, can display the same symptoms as Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore it is important to work closely with a physician to rule out other possible causes for the changes in behavior and thinking. Please see the Resources section of this fact sheet to find organizations and other resources dedicated to helping you learn more about these complex dementia related Parkinson’s conditions.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregiving/,Parkinson’s Disease and Caregiving,"Many resources are available online (See the Resources section of this fact sheet for more information), and public libraries have literature on the disease. Whenever possible, accompany the person with Parkinson’s to their medical appointments and ask questions of the doctor, nurse, and social worker.
The areas to assess include your loved one’s needs—both your perceptions and theirs, your home environment, and your own health, emotional state, and other commitments. The caregiver has to determine how much they can and can’t do themselves and what type of outside support is needed. It is also important to assess current and future financial issues such as health insurance coverage, employment (both caregiver and the person with Parkinson’s), managing expenses, and if/when to secure Power of Attorney.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregiving/,Parkinson’s Disease and Caregiving,"Probably one of the most important, and sometimes difficult, things caregivers can do is to take care of themselves. This includes maintaining mental and physical health by making and keeping your own medical and dental appointments. As a caregiver, it is important to keep your job whenever possible as it provides not only financial help and possibly insurance coverage, but also a sense of self-esteem. Join a support group for caregivers if possible. Support groups help you meet people who are going through what you are going though, vent frustrations, give and receive mutual support, and exchange resource information and coping strategies. Whenever possible get your sleep, take breaks, make and keep social activities, and try to keep your sense of humor.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregiving/,Parkinson’s Disease and Caregiving,"Get help—don’t try to do it all alone. By getting help, a caregiver can lessen their sense of isolation, and it gives you more confidence in your own caregiving ability. Having help increases your ability to think creatively and helps you get those needed breaks. Help is available through local and community services. These include neighbors, friends, churches, synagogues, senior centers, adult day health, Meals on Wheels, and door-to-door vans. For a fee there is in-home care for help with cooking, bathing, dressing, and meal preparation. Additionally, a social worker from your health plan or hospital can connect you with other services.",parkinsons-disease

As Parkinson’s disease progresses, the roles change and the person with Parkinson’s may go from being an independent head of the household to a very dependent person requiring a significant level of care. However, research shows that despite high levels of strain, caregivers with good quality relationships have reduced depression and better physical health. Remember, as a caregiver your service to your loved one is beyond measure in terms of love, depth of care, and concern.",parkinsons-disease

We support and assist caregivers of adults with chronic or disabling health conditions regardless of race, ancestry, national origin, creed, gender, gender identity, religion, sexual orientation, disability, income, or age.",parkinsons-disease

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Parkinson’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"This article is based on the video, Parkinson’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone. It aims to help you care for someone living with Parkinson’s disease. You may not feel prepared for this role, but there are many resources, and a community of professionals and Parkinson’s caregivers to help you. We will look at the early, middle, and late stages of Parkinson’s and focus on caregiving information and recommendations related to each stage. It will also cover what to expect, how to prepare, and provide strategies to help you along the way.
Let’s start with a quick overview of Parkinson’s disease.
Parkinson’s is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease that occurs when nerve cells in a part of the brain called the basal ganglia become impaired. This causes a decrease in the production of dopamine, which is essential for body movement.
In addition to the “movement symptoms” of Parkinson’s, such as tremors and muscle rigidity, many people will also experience a wide range of “non-movement symptoms.” These may include cognitive and hard-to-manage changes like dementia, hallucinations, and sleep problems.
The average age of diagnosis is 60 and risk increases with age. Keep in mind that symptoms develop slowly over time and can vary for each person.
The exact cause of Parkinson’s is unknown, yet researchers believe it may be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. For more information on Parkinson’s see the FCA article: Parkinson’s Disease and Caregiving.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Parkinson’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"In the early stages of Parkinson’s, people usually need more emotional support than hands-on care. You may notice some or all of the following changes:
tremors
muscle rigidity
changes in posture
facial expression changes
changes in speech.
Typically, symptoms will begin on one side of the body and progress to both sides over time.
These symptoms – and receiving a diagnosis – can be very distressing. The person with Parkinson’s may be in denial of their diagnosis. You may have to take the lead in researching information and resources. Newly diagnosed individuals and their families can join a support group to help ease anxiety and learn pro-active coping skills. Individual counseling may also be very helpful.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Parkinson’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"Parkinson’s disease can be difficult to diagnose as there is no definitive test, and other illnesses have similar symptoms in the early stages. Some individuals may receive an initial diagnosis of Parkinson’s, but additional testing or future symptoms may result in a different diagnosis.
Get started by connecting with medical providers who understand and have experience with the disease. The Parkinson’s Foundation website provides information on Centers of Excellence across the United States. Social workers can help connect you to resources and referrals in your community and provide you with supportive counseling.
Although there are no cures for Parkinson’s disease yet, there are ways to treat and manage symptoms. Surgical procedures, such as Deep Brain Stimulation or DBS, may be recommended for some. You may also want to explore current research opportunities where Parkinson’s-specific trials are being conducted.
If you are related to someone with Parkinson’s, you may be wondering if you should get tested. Only 10-15% of Parkinson’s cases are believed to be genetic. If you do decide to get tested, meet with a genetic counselor who can provide information, support, and guidance.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Parkinson’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"How are you feeling about your loved one’s diagnosis? Sadness, anger, fear? Disbelief? Perhaps you feel relief at finally having an explanation for the unusual changes you’ve been observing. All of these feelings are normal.
As a caregiver, you may experience many different emotions over time. Feelings of loss and frustration can be profound. Two types of loss common for caregivers are “ambiguous loss” and “anticipatory grief.”
Ambiguous loss is the loss we experience when someone is “there but not there” – when they’re not the same person they used to be.
Anticipatory grief occurs when we know a loss is coming, and we start grieving before it occurs.
In the early stages, it’s very important to find support and ways to cope with these feelings–even before you think you need it.
Although there is no one right way, there are healthy ways to deal with your feelings of anxiety, loss, and grief. Here are a few:
Write in a journal to name and express your feelings. Many caregivers find journaling, or writing in general, useful – even therapeutic.
Physical exercise
Prayer
Meditation,
Relaxation exercises
Support groups
Talking one-on-one with a friend or counselor
Creating new rituals for self-care
These activities can help you stay well and build resiliency. Engaging in activities that are fulfilling and decrease stress should be a priority.
Parkinson’s can affect everyone in the family in different ways. This includes you as the caregiver, the person with Parkinson’s, family, and friends. Each will require their own kind of support.
Both you and the person you care for will have to learn to balance Parkinson’s symptoms and care needs with the desire to be independent. You both should keep dates with friends, keep up with interests and hobbies, and do things that fill you with joy.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Parkinson’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"One common question that caregivers ask, is what will happen to the person I care for if something happens to me? One thing you can do is make sure that your own legal and financial documents are updated.
This is also a good time to encourage the person with Parkinson’s to make or update their legal and financial arrangements including making arrangements for dependents, especially before they experience significant cognitive changes. For them it’s best to speak with an attorney who specializes in disability and estate planning. Key documents to complete include:
Durable financial power of attorney
Advance Health Care Directive
Will and/or trust
POLST form which specifies end-of-life medical intervention.
This is also a good time for the person with Parkinson’s to sign a release of information, allowing medical staff to speak with you and others who are closely involved in their care.
If you or the person with Parkinson’s is employed, it is important to contact the Human Resources department to learn about eligible benefits, such as long-term disability and paid and unpaid family leave options.
Securing financial help from the government can be a challenging and confusing process. Seek out experts to help you early on. Consult with an attorney, a community organization or legal aid office that specializes in Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). They can also help you navigate Medicare and Medicaid.
A person is eligible for Medicare when they turn 65, or if they become disabled earlier and have been receiving SSDI for 24 months. It’s important to remember that Medicare does not pay for long-term care, such as care provided in an assisted living, skilled nursing facility, or for private care at home.
If the person you care for is a veteran, applying for benefits and enrolling in the VA health care system should be done as soon as possible. Your local Veterans Service Organization can offer guidance about service-connected Parkinson’s and assist with completing necessary paperwork.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Parkinson’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"In the middle stages of Parkinson’s, tremors, rigidity, and other movement symptoms will progress. The individual may experience more problems with walking and balance issues that will make falls more common. This can be coupled with slower mental processing, language, and with visual-spatial difficulties. You’ll need to help with basic personal care such as bathing, dressing, and brushing teeth.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Parkinson’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"As symptoms progress, it’s common for caregivers to feel isolated while dealing with new stages of grief and loss. Too often, just when you really need more support, friends and even family may step back, unable to witness your pain and your loved one’s decline. They may not understand the disease or how they can help. Reach out with suggestions or ways for them to be supportive. Contact a social worker for helpful resources or to facilitate a family meeting. This may also be the time to bring in outside assistance, whether from family, friends, or a hired caregiver.
If you’re feeling depressed, anxious, or angry; know that these emotions are hard to deal with on your own. Talk with your doctor or counselor. Attend a support group or retreat designed for caregivers. The Parkinson & Movement Disorder Alliance (PMD Alliance) website contains lists of support groups for both caregivers and people with Parkinson’s.
There are effective ways to help you cope and feel better. Don’t wait to ask for help! If you need more time-off, there are out-of-home respite options for your loved one, such as adult day programs or a short-term stay in a care facility.
Too often caregivers don’t feel they need a break until they experience a crisis or problem with their own health. We encourage you to seek respite early and as often as you need it. Some signs that you need more support and time to care for yourself include:
health issues, like a rash or an ache that won’t go away,
rising blood pressure,
chronic health conditions that are getting worse,
trouble sleeping,
feeling anxious, irritable and less patient,
turning to alcohol or drugs to relieve stress.
It may cause you anxiety to take time for yourself because you worry something bad will happen. Or you feel guilty. The truth is that it’s essential to confront these concerns and make time to step outside of the caregiver role for both you and the person you care for.
Be sure to prioritize your physical and emotional well-being!",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Parkinson’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"Because Parkinson’s causes unsteady movement, it’s important to identify potential hazards that may exist in the home. A Physical Therapist (PT), can complete an evaluation of the person, assess the home for safety issues, and suggest modifications, such as bathroom grab-bars for getting in and out of the shower. PTs can also recommend other types of equipment and ways to prevent falls and injury.
Staying active is vital for individuals with Parkinson’s disease. A range of Parkinson’s- specific exercise classes are available across the country and online, including boxing and dance classes. The PMD Alliance website provides a list of virtual exercise groups.
An Occupational Therapist, or OT, will help promote independence and safety for the person living with Parkinson’s. They can suggest assistive devices and tips to help with daily activities and personal care.
For safety outside of the home, we recommend the person with Parkinson’s carry an ID card or wear a bracelet that specifies their health condition and who to contact in an emergency.
You should also carry identification that you are a caregiver for someone who may need assistance if you become injured or unable to communicate.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Parkinson’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"As the disease progresses, swallowing issues, along with speech and voice disorders, can have a significant impact on the person’s quality of life.
Speech Therapist: It is recommended that the person you care for get a baseline speech evaluation, along with speech therapy, to help with difficulty talking and swallowing.
Dietitian: A dietitian can provide guidance on proper nutrition and create individualized meal plans as food can impact medications and non-movement symptoms. Dietitians can also help with planning the timing of meals and medications.
Palliative Care helps to improve the quality of life for people who have debilitating chronic health conditions. Palliative care teams can help manage symptoms and reduce suffering. A person does not have to be in hospice to qualify.
Contact the medical team for referrals to any of these services. And if it’s difficult to attend an appointment in-person, ask providers about tele-health or virtual visit options.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Parkinson’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"This is when the person will need assistance with pretty much all of their personal care. As symptoms progress, they will require assistance walking, and eventually it will be impossible to even stand. Some individuals may experience hallucinations and delusions, as well as other non-movement symptoms.
Talk with your medical team about all the ways to help reduce the person you care for’s pain or suffering and increase their comfort. Remember, you are their connection to quality care and services when they can no longer advocate for themselves.
There may come a time when the person living with Parkinson’s requires a higher level of care than can be provided at home. For some, the transition to a nursing facility can be a tough but necessary decision. You may feel like you’ve failed or you’re breaking a promise – even when you know that moving them will provide better care and safety.
If you’re considering a skilled nursing facility, it’s helpful to get a list of local options and be sure to visit. Even if the person you care for is living in a skilled nursing facility, your role as a caregiver does not end. Your presence and advocacy will help ensure that proper care is provided.",parkinsons-disease
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/parkinsons-disease-caregivers-youre-not-alone-article/,Parkinson’s Disease Caregivers: You’re Not Alone (article),"Hospice services are designed to support individuals towards the end of life. Care can be provided wherever the person resides – including at home or in a care facility. This includes visiting nurses, pain management, and personal care. Hospice can also provide spiritual, grief, and bereavement support as well as respite for family caregivers.
Hospice is a Medicare benefit and individuals are eligible when a doctor has determined a patient has 6 months or less to live. Ask your doctor for a referral to begin services, or hospice can assist you in getting a referral if the patient is eligible.",parkinsons-disease

In the past, doctors were unquestioned authorities who took the lead in discussions with their patients on medical care. But things have changed; the relationship has shifted.
The vast amount of information and resources online allows patients and their caregivers to educate themselves in a number of ways:
search for specialists
research diseases, medications, and treatments
explore alternatives
learn what others are doing in a similar situation
And health care professionals are moving towards partnership with you to achieve optimal treatment and care.
In this fact sheet are suggestions to help remove barriers and encourage meaningful communication between you and health care practitioners, as well as tips for becoming a true advocate on behalf of the person you care for.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/pathways-effective-communication-healthcare-providers-and-caregivers/,Pathways to Effective Communication for Health Care Providers and Caregivers,"As a caregiver and advocate for a friend or family member, you are likely to play a central role in partnering with health care professionals. If the person you care for has dementia or other memory problems, your responsibilities are especially important – the health professionals will count on you to share details about the individual’s current health and mental state. You’ll also manage many vital tasks:
collect information
speak to doctors
transport the patient
ensure lab tests are done
pick up, prepare, and give medications
research treatment options and risks
handle insurance
In addition to your role as caregiver, you’re also now a patient advocate. What happens, though, if – when you communicate the key information and anecdotes about your friend or family member – you don’t feel heard by the physicians, nurses, or other members of the care team?
Feeling as if professionals don’t value your opinions, observations, and insights is never easy. But a lot is at stake, you need to do something. But what?
Have your list of questions, records, or notes up front when talking to the doctors. If they notice a visual cue that you are organized with specific topics to cover, they’ll naturally pay closer attention to you and what you’re saying.
Speak up. Assertiveness does not always come easy. You may need to dig deep – but remember: Assertive is not the same as aggressive. And just as being aggressive isn’t the answer, neither is coming across as passive. Assertive communication is your best tool in conveying what’s necessary and getting what you need. Be respectful and be direct. Then let them know that you don’t feel heard.
Ask for a huddle (in-person or virtual) with all key members of your friend or family’s care team. If their manner feels dismissive or rushed, acknowledge how busy you know they are and ask for time on the calendar that day.
Call for backup. If you continue to feel dismissed, ask to speak with a social worker based within the medical center and request they step in and help. And if you’re still feeling unheard, reach out to the medical center’s ombudsman or patient advocate and file a complaint.
Just know that your dual role as caregiver and patient advocate is critical. Even if you’re frustrated, don’t feel helpless. There are steps you can take to improve the situation.",[]

new symptoms or changes in behavior or mood that worry you
reactions to medications
questions about an upcoming surgery or procedure
concern about the prognosis and how you can continue to provide the best care as the condition progresses

Regarding privacy, be sure to ask what permissions your friend or family member needs to have documented in their medical record to allow a health care professional to share patient information with you. (See HIPAA information below.)
Gather all the medications your friend or family member takes and either put them in a bag to bring to the appointment, or prepare a list, including dosages. This should include prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs, as well as all herbal, vitamin, and mineral supplements.
Bring insurance plan and provider information, including names of other health care practitioners the person you care for has seen recently.
Bring a mobile device with a calendar (e.g., a smart phone or tablet) or a paper-based pocket calendar, so you’ll be able to schedule future appointments on the spot.
Bring a recording device or a notebook and pen.
Keep notes on the information provided by the doctor for your personal review or to share with a family member or partner after the appointment.

What treatments are available? What are the benefits or risks? Why is this the preferred approach, and what is the likelihood of the treatment being successful?
What are the side effects of medication being prescribed? Does insurance cover the medication? If not, is there an equally good drug on the panel to use instead? Is there a less expensive alternative? Does this medicine conflict with anything my friend or family member already takes? How should it be taken (at what intervals, with or without food, for how long)? How soon might we see results?
What will this test show? What is involved? Are there risks or side effects? Is it necessary? How soon will we have results? Does insurance cover the cost?

It may fall to you as the caregiver to fill them in on medical history, allergic reactions, chronic conditions, symptoms, and other essential information. You may also need to provide similar information for nurses, physical therapists, dieticians and others.
If you are caring for someone with a memory disorder, be sure that hospital staff knows that, and that they do not rely on your friend or family member to communicate important medical details or medication history. Be aware also that people with Alzheimer’s or another cognitive disorder are likely to be even more confused and disoriented than usual when they’re in the hospital.
Even when there is shared electronic information within the hospital, you may need to repeat your answers.

HIPAA rules impact the sharing of information about patients in medical care. Although when the act was first initiated there was some confusion about how much information families and caregivers could receive about a patient’s medical situation, it is now clear that information must be shared.
The US Department of Health and Human Services says: If the patient is present and has the capacity to make health care decisions, a health care provider may discuss the patient’s health information with a family member, friend, or other person if the patient agrees or, when given the opportunity, does not object.
A health care provider also may share information with these persons if, using professional judgment, he or she decides that the patient does not object.
In either case, the health care provider may share or discuss only the information that the person involved needs to know about the patient’s care or payment for care. Particularly when you are named in an Advance Directive, there should be no problem with you being able to receive information about, and speak for, your friend or family member. Check to be sure that a current copy of the Advance Directive is in the patient file.",[]

They may also be referred to as living wills, health care proxies or Durable Powers of Attorney for Health Care.
These documents can only be completed when a person is competent to do so (i.e., does not have dementia).
They include instructions on the type of care individuals desire if they are very ill or dying.
Many doctors’ offices and hospitals have forms available.
For more in-depth information, check out this resource on Advanced Health Care Directives and POLST available on the FCA’s website (https://www.caregiver.org/resource/advance-health-care-directives-and-polst/?via=caregiver-resources,caring-for-another,advanced-illness-and-end-of-life).",[]

For those who primarily speak a different language, and your doctor does not speak your language, comprehension is difficult if not impossible – and resulting misinformation can be life-threatening.
Fortunately, based on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, patients have the right to the services of an interpreter—including sign language interpreters—in health care settings.
Although there are now national certification programs to ensure that interpreters are competent to translate medical/health care language, there is still wide variation from state to state in the availability of such interpreters.
Some families simply use a relative to provide translation, but unless they are familiar with medical terminology, that may not be the best choice when complicated information is delivered or treatment decisions must be made.
Be sure to request a professional interpreter if you will need one. Hospitals and clinicians are legally required to provide that service to you, so if a professional interpreter is unavailable, the health care organization should make arrangements for translation services via video or telephone.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/pathways-effective-communication-healthcare-providers-and-caregivers/,Pathways to Effective Communication for Health Care Providers and Caregivers,"Many caregivers find it useful to keep a medical notebook (either electronic or paper) for the person they provide care for. In these notebooks, caregivers capture dates, activities, symptoms, treatments, doctors seen, emergency room visits, future appointments, medications—whatever will help track your friend or family member’s condition. Also included is information found on the web, and questions for the next medical appointment or conversation with a clinician or health care representative.
Not all medical information on the Internet is equal. Some sites are selling products; some authors do not have legitimate credentials; some sites or groups focus only on bad outcomes or complications or rely on anecdotal evidence of “cures.”
Get your information from major government sites – website URLs with .gov(for example, National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Aging, MedLine); nonprofit disease-specific organizations (.org); well-known medical schools (.edu) and health care centers (for example, Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Kaiser Permanente); or other recognized sources of quality health information.
Regarding medication, it’s important you have a complete explanation of why, how, how much, and when medications should be taken – and report to the doctor any side effects or reactions. Medication errors are a common cause of readmissions to hospitals, and sometimes the errors are caused by miscommunication.
Pharmacists are good sources of information on drug interactions and side effects. Day-by-day pill organizers and dispensers can be a big help to frazzled caregivers with a lot on their minds.
If the person you care for has dementia, keep all medications locked away in a safe place.
If you are dissatisfied with care, be direct in stating your needs – whether it’s phone calls not returned, a rude assistant at the front desk, your concerns not being addressed, or unclear instructions for treatment. While health care practitioners are always pressed for time, if your friend or family member is not getting the care they need, you have a right to speak up.
If you are concerned about care in a rehabilitation or nursing home facility, contact the ombudsperson (go to theconsumervoice.org, click Get Help).

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/personal-care-agreements/,Personal Care Agreements,"Many families reach a point when they recognize that an ill or older relative needs help. There are usually warning signs: difficulty with daily activities; memory problems; trouble with banking and finances; multiple falls; problems with driving; forgetting medications. Sometimes an elderly or ill loved one needs more than occasional assistance — they need full-time care.
But who will provide that care? The answer is usually close to home: an adult child. One sibling might become the caregiver by default, or one is selected because he or she lives closer or has fewer family responsibilities of his/her own.
The person providing care for a loved one may make a significant sacrifice: giving up a job and employment benefits. A formal agreement among family members can provide a way to compensate a person providing care if he or she is no longer able to hold other employment. Even though most family members want to help and feel a sense of duty to care for a loved one, it is a job with heavy time commitments and responsibilities. One way of protecting the caregiver as well as the person receiving care is by putting the care relationship in writing.
This is a binding agreement, also called a long-term care personal support services agreement, elder care contract, or family care or caregiver contract. Most often, it is called a personal care agreement. This agreement can offer family caregivers security that they will not suffer undue financial consequences. At the same time, the agreement can also offer your loved one peace of mind that she or he has a caring advocate to manage care needs.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/personal-care-agreements/,Personal Care Agreements,"The agreement is a contract typically between a family member who agrees to provide caregiver services for a disabled or aging relative and the person receiving care. The personal care agreement is most commonly between an adult child or and his/her parent, but other relatives may be involved, such as an adult grandchild caring for a grandparent.
Drawing up an agreement clarifies for a family what tasks are expected in return for a stated compensation. It can help avoid family conflicts about who will provide care and how much money will change hands. For this reason, the agreement should be discussed with other family members to resolve any concerns before an agreement is drafted.
When contracting with a family member, it is wise to treat the agreement as a legal document. If your relative is receiving state supported in-home care, the agreement will show the state where the money is going and for what kind of services. In addition, a caregiver agreement can offset potential confusion among family members concerned about bequests to heirs, and avoid misunderstandings later over the reduction of the amount of money that may be inherited.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/personal-care-agreements/,Personal Care Agreements,"A personal care agreement has three basic requirements for a person to pay a family member for care:
The agreement must be in writing.
The payment must be for care provided in the future (not for services already performed).
Compensation for care must be reasonable. This means it should not be more than what would be paid to a third party for the same care in your state or geographic area. Tasks performed should match “reasonable” or “customary” fees typically charged for those services.
A properly drafted personal care agreement will contain:
Date the care begins
Detailed description of services to be provided, for example, transportation and errands: driving to medical, dental, adult day care, and other appointments, food preparation
How often services will be provided (Allow for flexibility in care needs by using language such as, “no less than 20 hours a week” or “up to 80 hours a month.”)
How much and when the caregiver will be compensated (weekly or biweekly)
How long the agreement is to be in effect (The agreement should set time, such as a year or two years, or even over a personʼs lifetime.)
A statement that the terms of the agreement can be modified only by mutual agreement of the parties in writing
The location where services are to be provided (home of elder/adult with disabilities, caregiverʼs own home, other location. Allow for the location of the care to change in response to increasing care receiver needs.)
Signatures by the parties, date of the agreement
 ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/personal-care-agreements/,Personal Care Agreements,"The caregiver’s tasks should be clearly stated in the agreement but might include the term “or similar to be mutually agreed upon by the parties” for flexibility. If the agreement is too rigid, it will have to be rewritten if circumstances change.
Consider creating an “escape clause” in the event that one of the parties wants to terminate the contract. Use a term such as “this agreement remains in effect until terminated in writing by either party.” Consider a provision that “springs” into action if the caregiver becomes ill or wants a vacation. Is there a designated backup person who can step in temporarily?
Is there a provision for room and board costs if the care recipient lives with the caregiver (a proportional share of utilities, mortgage, insurance, taxes)? Consider what happens if the care recipient moves into a care facility. Will health insurance or a long-term care insurance policy be purchased to cover the family caregiver? If so, include that in the personal care agreement and be specific without being inflexible. Consider adding an allowance for easy-to-overlook out-of-pocket expenses.
To determine the level of care required, consult with a local homecare agency, physician, geriatric care manager, hospital discharge planner, or social worker. There may be a fee involved to conduct a care assessment in the home. This will also help in anticipating any future care needs. If the care receiver has dementia, for example, a decline could require different care options.
Examples of care are: personal care, grocery shopping, preparing meals, housekeeping, laundry, coordinating household and medical bills, making phone calls, financial management, transportation (consider mileage), monitoring and managing medications, tracking changes in health, and liaison with healthcare practitioners.
When preparing an agreement, ask yourself what each care task means. Define, for example, what “personal care” is: does it include bathing, dressing, dental hygiene? If you specifically define the care tasks and the time required, the result will be a more realistic caregiving assessment.
Caregivers should maintain a detailed daily log and have a concise job description. Documentation will support the intent of your contractual relationship if for any reason it comes into question.
You are creating a contractual relationship between employer (care recipient) and employee (caregiver), a relationship that requires withholding and paying taxes. Other considerations are whether to provide employee benefits such as health insurance or workersʼ compensation. In the area of taxes and Social Security, you may want to seek the advice of an attorney to confirm what applies in your situation. Consider a vacation pay provision to offset caregiver stress or a raise after one year for a job well done.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/personal-care-agreements/,Personal Care Agreements,"A stressful conversation for any family is what happens to the money when a parent becomes ill, and who will serve as the primary caregiver. One method for discussing difficult topics is holding a family meeting. The caregiving team meets in a comfortable place, seated around a table with room to spread out documents under discussion. (Using technology such as Skype may help to include family members who live far away.) A well-organized meeting can provide the family members with shared support and a better understanding of the decisions to be made.
When planning the family meeting, itʼs important to include all necessary members. One question to consider is whether the person receiving care will attend. If your loved one has a cognitive condition (Alzheimerʼs disease or another dementia, for instance), consider whether or not he or she has the capacity to understand the discussion and whether itʼs likely to be upsetting. Are there “hot-button” issues not to be discussed in their presence? How critical is it for them to participate in decisions made on their behalf? Attending all or part of the meeting may allow the care receiver to build trust in the caregiving team. This can help later with their cooperation when tougher decisions must be made.
Before the meeting, itʼs best to set times and dates convenient (as much as possible) for everyoneʼs schedule, then create your meeting agenda.
Hereʼs a suggested list of topics to keep the discussion on track:
Definition of the caregiverʼs role, with tasks clearly delineated
The duration of the agreement
Compensation for caregiving, including how it will be paid (weekly, monthly, lump sum?)
Financial changes to the family estate (present and future impact)
Who holds Power of Attorney?
Who will serve as a backup should the caregiver become sick or need respite?
Are there Medicaid “spend down” or “look back” period considerations?
Is there a Health Care Directive?
Is a physician on the team?
How does the care receiver perceive his/her quality of life and independence? (What are their wishes?)
What is the plan if it becomes time for placement in a residential facility?
If possible, record your meeting or have someone take notes. You might distribute meeting notes to other family members for future reference. Consider building a “personal care agreement” binder that contains necessary documentation. One person should facilitate the meeting to keep the discussion moving or to set boundaries if the discussion gets out of hand. Some families choose to use an outside facilitator, a social worker, clergy member, geriatric care manager, or another person without a vested interest in the meetingʼs outcomes. More than one meeting may be necessary.
Below are a few examples of what documents that may be helpful:
Documentation showing the median hourly compensation for a caregiver in your area (Call local home care agencies to get a sense of costs.)
Medical records relevant to caregiver tasks
The completed care assessment documenting level of care
Additional legal documents such as Health Care Directive, Power of Attorney
Financial documents and will and trust agreements
Should the meetings not reach desired goals, family mediation is a growing trend in the U.S., helping families deal with major life transitions. For more information, see the National Care Planning Council noted in the Resources section at the end of this fact sheet.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/personal-care-agreements/,Personal Care Agreements,"You don’t necessarily need to hire an attorney, but it may be advisable when entering into a contractual relationship. It depends on your set of circumstances and how complex an agreement your family requires. If you are considering a pre-paid, lump-sum caregiver contract, you may want to consult with a lawyer. A lump-sum contract is complex, and it’s more difficult to show compensation in terms of “fair market” value for care services. A monthly or bi-weekly salary for care services is easier to track, especially for Medicaid purposes. If you are not comfortable with these transactions, consult an attorney to avoid conflict later.
Another legal consideration is if the care receiver lacks capacity to sign the agreement. The person holding the Power of Attorney or the guardian or conservator may sign. If the family caregiver also holds the care receiver’s Power of Attorney or legal guardianship, consider consulting with an attorney. If you feel there is no need for an attorney, see examples of agreements in the Resources section.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/personal-care-agreements/,Personal Care Agreements,"Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California) is a state and federal program that may pay for long-term care costs for people with limited income and assets. To qualify for Medicaid, a personʼs spending and assets are subject to a “look-back” period of up to five years. This is sometimes called the asset “spend down.” If the care receiver needs to enter a facility or apply for other services that Medicaid might pay for, the personal care agreement can show that care payments were a legitimate expense and not an attempt to hide assets by giving cash to family members. The care receiver is paying for the “value” in personal care services.
Check your state for Medicaid rules since regulations do vary from state to state. These regulations are complicated, and you may want to consult an elder law attorney for help in qualifying for Medicaid or Medi-Cal.",[]

The Medicare program is rolling out its prescription drug benefit, Medicare Part D, on January 1, 2006.  The intention is to provide prescription drug benefits for more than 42 million elderly and disabled people.  and ease the high cost of prescription medications for many of us.
As the federal government enacts this massive program and health insurers begin signing up customers across the country, caregivers covered by Medicare will need to make decisions about their own prescription coverage as well as that of their loved ones.
We encourage you to take your time, do the necessary research, and make careful, well-informed decisions. You can sign up for the new Medicare drug benefit starting November 15, 2005, but the final deadline for enrollment without penalty is not until May 2006.
In addition to the Medicare program, voters in California will choose between two competing measures, Propositions 78 and 79 on the November ballot, which also seek to create prescription drug discount programs.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/preparing-change-new-options-prescription-drug-coverage/,Preparing for Change: New Options for Prescription Drug Coverage-Advice for Caregivers,"Use the next several months to learn about your options and seek help from organizations and government agencies that can answer your questions about the new prescription drug benefits.
To help in your decision-making, save information sent from the government on the Medicare Part D changes, especially the Medicare & You handbook. Watch for information from former insurance companies, employers or other sources of current drug coverage. Do not divulge your Social Security numbers and finance information to marketers who are selling drug coverage plans over the phone.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recommend that caregivers:
Look over any current health insurance coverage that your family member has. Are prescription drugs covered? What are the out-of-pocket drug costs?
Make a list of the name, dosage, frequency and cost of the prescriptions your loved one uses. Since different plans will cover different drugs, this will help determine which plan best meets your family member or friend’s prescription needs.
If you are the legal representative for the person you care for (such as through a Power of Attorney), you can enroll him or her in a Medicare prescription drug plan. You can also fill out the application to get extra help on his or her behalf.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/preparing-change-new-options-prescription-drug-coverage/,Preparing for Change: New Options for Prescription Drug Coverage-The Basics of Medicare Part D,"Medicare Part D was established by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) and is designed to lower the cost of prescription drugs for many senior and disabled Medicare beneficiaries. It will replace the Medicare discount drug card and transitional assistance program started last year.
The new drug benefit presents a wide—and potentially confusing—array of new options to Medicare beneficiaries. Beginning in January, beneficiaries will be covered for prescription drugs by private insurance plans that contract with Medicare to provide the new benefit. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in Medicare Advantage, Medicare’s managed care program for all Medicare benefits including drug coverage, or enroll in a separate prescription drug coverage plan and get other benefits from Medicare or Medigap policies. Coverage from Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California), or retirement programs also may change. It is important to understand that premiums, deductibles, co-payments and medications covered vary from plan to plan.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/preparing-change-new-options-prescription-drug-coverage/,Preparing for Change: New Options for Prescription Drug Coverage-The “Standard” Medicare Drug Benefit,"Health care plans participating in Medicare Part D are required to offer enrollees the “standard” benefit, which in 2006 includes:
A monthly premium, estimated to average $32 per month nationally (amount will vary across plans and regions);
A $250 deductible;
Cost-sharing: after the deductible, Medicare drug plans will pay 75 percent of  drug costs and enrollees will pay the remaining 25 percent until the total drug costs reach $2,250;
Gap in coverage: enrollees will be responsible for all drug costs between $2,251 and $5,100 (referred to as the coverage “doughnut hole”); and
More cost-sharing: once total drug costs reach $5,100, Medicare drug plans will pay 95 percent and enrollees will pay up to five percent of remaining drug costs.
Medicare drug plans will have some flexibility in deciding which drugs to cover and will create a list of covered drugs (known as a formulary), which will be subject to federal approval. (Formulary information for Medicare drug plans is available online at www.medicare.gov. Those who don’t use online services can call (800) MEDICARE. Enrollees will have to pay out-of-pocket for any drug that the plan does not cover, and that payment will not count toward the cost-sharing coverage limits. Medicare drug plans may also offer more comprehensive coverage with higher premiums.
Enrollment in Medicare drug plans is voluntary for most beneficiaries. Dual eligibles—people who are enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid—will be automatically enrolled if they do not join a plan on their own by January 1, 2006.
Others will need to enroll during open enrollment, which will be from November 15, 2005 to May 15, 2006. If you or a loved one become eligible for Medicare after the initial enrollment period, there will be a seven-month period to enroll, including the three months before and three months after the month you become eligible.
To encourage seniors to enroll in Medicare Part D immediately, a late enrollment penalty will be applied for those who enroll after the initial open enrollment period. The penalty will be applied to individuals who do not enroll when they are first eligible and who do not have other prescription drug coverage. (Other coverage must be at least as good as Medicare’s coverage—it must be creditable coverage.) The penalty will be paid in the form of higher monthly premiums, and the penalty amount increases every month until enrollment is complete.
Your current coverage will  determine your enrollment options in the new Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit. See Table below, Summary of Options Under Medicare Part D. .",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/preparing-change-new-options-prescription-drug-coverage/,Preparing for Change: New Options for Prescription Drug Coverage-Additional Medicare Subsidies for Low-Income Beneficiaries,"In addition to the standard benefit offered under Medicare Part D, the Medicare plan includes significant federal subsidies to reduce costs for lower-income beneficiaries receiving the new prescription drug coverage.
An estimated 14.4 million beneficiaries—one-third of the Medicare population—will be eligible for this additional assistance in 2006. Dual eligibles will automatically be deemed eligible for low-income subsidies. Consumers who are low income but not dually eligible may also qualify for subsidies. Many low-income beneficiaries will receive coverage for the standard benefit with much lower or no monthly premiums. Contact the Social Security Administration for more information.
Note: Recent news reports indicate that there is a factual error pertaining to the new prescription drug benefit in the Medicare booklets, Medicare & You. The booklets incorrectly list all plans available for those with limited assets and income as having no monthly premium. However, only about 40 percent of the plans actually qualify for no premium. Please be sure that you have accurate information before signing up for a plan. For clarification, contact the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) or the other helpful Medicare Resources listed here.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/preparing-change-new-options-prescription-drug-coverage/,Preparing for Change: New Options for Prescription Drug Coverage-Other Prescription Drug Discount Options,"In addition to the publicly funded prescription drug benefits being introduced through Medicare Part D, there are also various discount programs available to consumers, including drug company discount cards, private insurance (HMO or PPO), discount pharmacies, and other sources of assistance.
Drug discount cards offered through Medicare-approved HMO plans will be replaced by the new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefits. You may use your Medicare-approved drug discount card until May 15, 2006 or until you join a Medicare
Prescription drug plan, whichever is first. Once you have a Medicare prescription drug plan, you can no longer use your Medicare-approved drug discount card.
Many pharmaceutical companies offer discount cards to help consumers save money on the prescription drugs that the company makes and sells. There is usually no fee for these cards. It is anticipated that drug discount programs offered by both private insurance and pharmaceutical companies will change as a result of Medicare Part D.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/preparing-change-new-options-prescription-drug-coverage/,Preparing for Change: New Options for Prescription Drug Coverage-Propositions 78 and 79 Add Further Options,"As we go to press, two measures on the November 8 special election ballot in California also seek to create prescription drug discount programs. One measure is sponsored by a coalition of pharmaceutical companies and the other is sponsored by a coalition of labor and healthcare advocacy groups.
The dueling initiatives, Propositions 78 and 79, share the same goal and are part of a nationwide movement to reduce drug prices to consumers. Each proposition seeks to establish a prescription drug discount program for low- and moderate-income Californians by negotiating for rebates from drug manufacturers.
Both propositions have restrictions indicating that the discounts are for those Californians who do not already receive drug coverage from private health insurance, Medi-Cal, or the Healthy Families programs. Medicare beneficiaries, however, can receive discounts for drugs they purchase which are not covered by Medicare.
Under both proposed plans, lower-income residents who lack prescription drug coverage would pay a modest annual fee for a discount card that could be used throughout California. The state would negotiate with drug companies for reduced drug rates for cardholders.
Key differences between Propositions 78 and 79 include:
eligibility requirements and the subsequent potential number of beneficiaries;
annual cost to consumers; and
whether participation by the drug manufacturers is mandatory  or voluntary.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/preparing-change-new-options-prescription-drug-coverage/,Preparing for Change: New Options for Prescription Drug Coverage,"Under Proposition 78, backed by the pharmaceutical industry, discounts on prescription drugs would be provided to those earning up to three times the federal poverty level ($28,710 for an individual or $58,050 for a family of four). The proposition, if passed, would require beneficiaries to pay an annual application fee of $15 and would provide benefits for an estimated five million Californians. Drug companies would negotiate volume discounts voluntarily.
Proposition 79, supported by union, health care and consumer groups, calls for discounts for those earning up to four times the federal poverty level ($38,280 for an individual or $77,000 for a family of four).
Proposition 79 would require beneficiaries to pay an annual application fee of $10. This plan would serve an estimated 10 million Californians. Drug company participation in providing discounts would be mandatory. In addition, under Proposition 79, individuals could sue a pharmaceutical company if they believed it participated in illegal pricing practices.
Each measure seeks to benefit from California’s purchasing clout, but Proposition 79 does so by utilizing what some have called the “Medicaid hammer.” A company that refuses to offer what state negotiators deem to be a sufficient discount could have its drugs removed from the formulary of the state Medicaid program. (Medi-Cal, California’s Medicaid program, has an annual drug budget of more than $4 billion.)
In the event that a company’s drugs are removed from the Medi-Cal formulary, doctors would have to receive “prior authorization” from Medi-Cal before prescribing a restricted drug to a Medi-Cal patient. In other words, doctors could still prescribe a noncompliant company’s drug, but that drug would be removed from a “preferred list.”
This key difference—whether Californians should embrace a voluntary or mandatory approach—is resulting in a costly political battle. The pharmaceutical industry, backing the voluntary approach, had by press time collected more than $80 million for its pro-78/anti-79 campaign. The proponents of Proposition 79, California consumer and labor groups, have raised about $1.8 million. The campaigns for Propositions 78 and 79 are attracting national attention, as pharmaceutical companies worry that the outcome of the vote on the two measures could affect the national debate.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/residential-care-options-caregiving-doesnt-end-when-your-loved-one-moves/,Residential Care Options: Caregiving Doesn’t End When Your Loved One Moves,"After your loved one moves to a facility, what happens? What is your role as a caregiver? How often should you visit? How can you best help your loved one adjust to their new living environment? How do you cope with your feelings about the move? Here are some tips to help you answer these questions and more.
In the first two to four weeks, visit often. It’s important for your loved one to not feel abandoned. Go daily if possible, even several times a day. More frequent visits are more important than longer visits. Together, take strolls around the facility, point out different areas, visit the garden or library. Bring favorite foods as treats.
 Introduce your loved one (and yourself) to the staff. Tell them about his or her life to help them get to know your loved one. Create a poster of your loved one’s life and hang it in the room for all to see. This is a way to honor your loved one and who they are as well as who they were, while helping the staff and others to appreciate their unique history.
 When your loved one is settled and comfortable, start visiting every other day, and then every third day, if that feels okay to you. Create a schedule that works for you. Visit during “free time” when there are not other activities going on. Don’t stay too long. Visit at different times of the day to see how he or she is doing throughout the day, including meal times.
 If your loved one has dementia, remember that his or her experience of your visit will be the same if you stay twenty minutes or two hours. Find the length of time for your visit that works for you. (For more suggestions on visits to a loved one with memory loss, see the FCA Tip Sheet, Visiting Someone in Dementia Care.)
 Unless your loved one really likes to go for drives, postpone outings until he or she is adjusted to the new environment. Think about whether the trip is for their sake or yours (to feel you are doing something good or perhaps to reduce guilt)?
 Decorate the space, whether it’s a shared room or private. Have familiar objects around such as family pictures, artwork, flowers, plants. Use the wall poster to tell your loved one’s story and to give you something to talk about when you visit.
 Attend activities with your loved one to help them get oriented and involved in the community. Play games that he or she used to like, such as cards, dominoes, or Scrabble. Watch television or videos of old movies together. Listen to music they like. Talk about sports. Sit together and hold hands—people in facilities don’t get touched much except when someone is “doing” something for them. You might also be experiencing this loss of touch and intimacy.
 Bring old photo albums, or go online to visit Facebook pages. Share stories of what other family members are doing.
 If you know someone else has recently visited, remind your loved one that they came. Leave a journal in the room for guests to leave a friendly note and read the notes back to your loved one.
 Visit together with a family member or friend. (And go out for lunch or coffee together afterwards as a treat for yourself!) If the facility and your loved one’s condition allow, brief visits with children or small pets can be great diversions.
 Reassure your loved one that he or she is safe, loved, and cared for.
 Understand that the care staff in the facility will not do things exactly the way you do. They will do things differently. But you can provide some of the hands-on care if you want.
Be clear about your care expectations and be willing to share with the staff what has been successful for you in the past.
  If you have concerns about the care your loved one is getting, speak up. Talk to the director or nurse. Do not just ignore issues until they have become major problems.
Create a relationship with staff members who take care of your loved one. Greet them by name, offer praise when they do something especially helpful for your family member.
Remember it takes a while to establish trust. Treat everyone with respect.
Be aware that when a staff who you like and trust leaves, it can be hard for you and your loved one to adjust. Take the time to recognize the loss and plan for how to get to know the new staff.
  If you are still concerned about the quality of care your loved one is getting, contact the long-term care ombudsman in your area (information should be posted at every facility) or go to www.ltcombudsman.org.
 Moving a loved one to an assisted care residence can be emotionally difficult. Grieve.  Allow yourself to feel sad, depressed, angry, disappointed, worried, anxious, but also relief, peaceful and calm. You may feel many emotions as a result of this decision. This is a hard transition and these feelings are necessary to start the healing process. But avoid guilt—you are not responsible for your loved one’s illness or their need for more care.
You may experience ambiguous loss—someone is “there but not there.” (See the FCA Fact Sheet Grief and Loss.)
  Practice letting go. It’s okay for you to have a life outside of caregiving. Your renewed energy will make it easier to visit and you will have more to share. You have a right to enjoy your life. Embrace the transition of your role from a full-time caregiver to a spouse, adult child, or friend.
Be clear about your care expectations and be willing to share with the staff what has been successful for you in the past.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/residential-care-options-choosing-right-place/,Residential Care Options: Choosing the Right Place,"Determine what level of care your loved one needs (see FCA’s Tip Sheet Residential Care Options: Housing Options).
 Be honest about the care needs of your loved one and communicate them clearly to facility staff. The right placement is important. Will it be appropriate for both the physical and/or cognitive impairments of my loved one?
Think not just about present needs, but also future needs. Will this facility be right when the illness or frailness progresses and dependent care needs increase?
  Can residents move from one level of care to another in the same facility? Who decides about higher levels of care—the facility, the resident, and/or the family?
 Be clear about finances. Unless you’ve chosen to pay for this care yourself, or as a family, only the resident’s funds should be used for payment. Then, if funds run out, there will be clear responsibility for payment. This may affect eventual eligibility for Medicaid. Become familiar with Medicaid rules in your state so you can pre-plan appropriately.
Clarify how much it will cost now and how much if care needs increase. Is there an automatic yearly fee increase? Is it limited to a certain percentage?
  Small facility or larger facility? This depends not only on what your loved one’s care needs are but also on how social they tend to be. Do they do best in a quiet, calm atmosphere or better in a more active environment? Does your loved one need more privacy or more social engagement?
 Geography. The closer your loved one is to where you live, the more often you will be able to visit. It will be easier to drop in for a short period of time. (See the FCA Tip Sheets, Residential Care Options: Visiting Someone in Dementia Care, and Residential Care Options: Caregiving Doesn’t End When Your Loved One Moves) Proximity will also help you to coordinate doctor appointments, dentists, hair dressers, podiatrists, and shopping—all of which will be easier in your own neighborhood. Sometimes it is better to choose a less ideal place for a closer one. There is an old adage which has some truth: The more often you visit, the better care your loved one will receive. You will begin to know the staff and they will begin to know you. If you are a long-distance caregiver and your loved one is going to stay in his or her own community, then, again, you want a facility as close as possible to family, friends, or neighbors who will visit.
 Visit the facility. Have a meal. Talk with current residents and their families. Watch how staff interacts with residents. Do residents seem happy, respected, and well cared for?
 Use your senses to evaluate. Look at the setting from the point of view of your loved one, not yourself. What does it look like, what sounds do you hear, what are the smells? What is your gut reaction to this environment? What would your loved one think is important?
 Observe social activities—would they be of interest to your loved one, are events well attended and engaging to those present?
Check the activity schedule. Are there organized outings? Are there religious services at the facility? Will these services be pleasing or offensive to your loved one? Are there accommodations for cultural differences? What holidays are celebrated and in what manner? Will staff help get your loved one to these activities?
  What kind of special diets can be accommodated? Is the food nutritious and appealing? If your loved one has dietary restrictions, will that be a problem? Are only certain foods served in the residence due to religious practices? If your loved one needs assistance feeding him- or herself, is staff available to help? Will someone make sure he/she gets to the dining room on time and has someone to sit with?
    What can and can’t be brought with you? Will you be able to decorate with furniture, familiar objects, and special mementos? Are pets allowed to live there? Visit? Is there a garden? What is the outdoor area like and how is it accessed? Can residents go in and out on their own? At any time? What are the other amenities, like beauty shop, podiatrist visits, shopping trips, Wi-Fi, telephone, cable TV? If your family member smokes or drinks how is that accommodated?
 Ask about training. Is the staff trained in dementia care? Do the caregivers get continuing education?
 Is there a doctor who primarily sees patients at this facility? Should you use this doctor or keep your loved one’s current primary care physician? Is there a pharmacy that is used or do you need to be responsible for picking up medications? Is this pharmacy covered by your loved one’s insurance? Is the facility the liaison with the primary care physician or will you be coordinating care?
 Be clear about the contract. Read it. If you don’t understand anything in the contract ask for clarification by email so that you have it in writing. What are the policies and procedures for admission, discharge, and retention, as well as transfers or room changes within the facility, refund policy, trial periods, or just coming for a respite break?
There may be a clause about utilizing binding arbitration instead of going to court if a serious disagreement arises. You have an option to sign this or not.  A federal ruling no longer permits this type of clause in a nursing home contract.
  Ask about the grievance procedures. Find the name/number of the ombudsman for the facility. Is there a resident council or a family council? Family support group meetings?  
Think not just about present needs, but also future needs. Will this facility be right when the illness or frailness progresses and dependent care needs increase?

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/residential-care-options-housing-options/,Residential Care Options: Housing Options,"Choosing the right place for a loved one to live, if not at home can be challenging. The options available depend on the kind of care that is needed, your loved one’s personal preferences, and finances. All facilities require a TB skin test and medical form completed by the doctor before admission.
Some decisions can be made proactively, before there is a need, such as investigating independent living, Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs), or Multi-Level Retirement Communities (MLRCs). Other times the decision is made reactively—when the need is immediate. It may be helpful to find a facility that has multiple levels of care, or you may do well with a facility that does the one specific thing you need, e.g., dementia care. If you are comfortable with changes in living situations, you can make a decision based on current needs, knowing that you might have to change to a different situation as your loved one’s care needs increase.
There is a spectrum of residential living facilities available to seniors and people with disabilities. They range from total independence to dependent care provided in skilled nursing facilities. Below are the kinds of care outside the home that are found in most urban and suburban communities. Fewer housing options are available in rural communities. These facilities may go by different names in your area. To get information on local residential options search senior housing online and call your local AAA (Area Agency on Aging) located in each county. In some areas you can find AAAs by dialing 211, or on FCA’s Family Care Navigator.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/residential-care-options-housing-options/,Residential Care Options: Housing Options,"Also known as Retirement Community or Senior Living Complex, this is a non-medical living situation that allows people to live in their own apartment. Some subsidized independent living is available for individuals with low income—often federally funded U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) housing.
Provides: May include an optional meal plan, housekeeping, social/recreational activities and outings, and transportation to shopping and medical appointments. Some offer emergency alert system in apartments.
Options: For an extra charge, may include medication management and help with personal care.
Requirements: Ability to be active and independent in most aspects of life, such as socializing, walking, dressing/personal grooming, meal prep, money management, etc.
Cost: Costs vary greatly due to location and overall scale of the community. Available housing cost subsidies are typically governed by state and federal regulations. Most subsidized housing has a waiting list. Be sure to ask about the criteria for how someone is selected off of the list, e.g. first-come-first-serve, or need based, etc. If care services are needed, such as medication management, bathing assistance, etc., it may be available for purchase at the residence or hired independently through an outside agency.
Advantages: Independence and privacy; freedom to come and go as desired; freedom to cook for one’s self if you like; and sometimes larger apartments and resident parking.
Disadvantages: If a resident requires more care due to physical or cognitive decline, they might need to move to another facility or another level of care within this facility. Or the resident would be responsible for hiring in-home care in order to stay in the apartment.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/residential-care-options-housing-options/,Residential Care Options: Housing Options,"Continuing Care Retirement Communities are a buy-in model: you own your own home or condominium. However, CCRCs have all levels of care, from independent living to skilled nursing, and there is usually a lifetime contract for care within the facility. There may be a large campus with individual homes as well as buildings with apartment/condo-like residences.
Provides: Most services including meals, social and recreational activities, personal care and medication management, to skilled nursing care as needed. Often has recreational facilities and other services such as swimming pool, tennis courts, salon/spa, theater, chapel, resident parking, ride service for non-drivers, etc.
Options: Depending on the CCRC agreement, residents may have access to, or be able to hire, help in order to stay in independent living rather than moving to the assisted living part of the facility.
Requirements: Financial eligibility determined by residence.
Costs: Depends on the residence, but generally equivalent to buying a house in the community. Monthly fees are charged which can be upwards to several thousand dollars, in addition to a buy-in fee. Some facilities will provide lifetime care if the individual runs out of money. Long-term care insurance usually does not cover independent living, although it might help if additional care is needed for assisted living or a hired caregiver. Medicare/Medicaid might cover some nursing home care if it is accepted by the facility. Read the contract carefully as there are several different kinds of CCRC agreements.
Advantages: All levels of care are provided in the same community, so there is no need to be uprooted if care needs change. There is usually a lifetime contract so that care is provided even if resident’s finances are depleted. Most CCRCs allow the resident to sell the condo when they are no longer living in it (if it is privately owned).
Disadvantages: May have to use the facility’s medical team as opposed to an outside physician. Tends to be very expensive to buy into the community. Some preclude someone with a pre-existing condition such as a diagnosis of dementia, from purchasing a contract.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/residential-care-options-housing-options/,Residential Care Options: Housing Options,"Similar to CCRCs in services provided and options available, with all levels of care on the same campus (independent living, assisted living, skilled nursing), however the resident rents the apartment/room, rather than buying in.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/residential-care-options-housing-options/,Residential Care Options: Housing Options,"Also known as Personal Care Homes, Assisted Living Homes, Residential Care Facilities, Residential Care Homes, Adult Home, Adult Foster Care. States have different names for this type of residence.
Non-medical care in a home with fewer than six residents; some private and some shared bedrooms. (Note: The number of residents permitted with this licensing varies from state to state.) Residents share living space, may share a bathroom. The goal is to provide small, intimate, and personalized care in a home-like setting for residents.
Provides: Meals, personal care (bathing, grooming, dressing, incontinence care, help with eating and meal prep, laundry), housekeeping. May offer activities and help with transportation to medical appointments.
Options: Provides medication management, either self-administered or staff-administered, depending on licensing requirements. Some homes have special waivers or licenses to provide psychiatric care, dementia care, and hospice care. For people who have sleeping problems or who tend to wander, look for a home with staff who are awake at night (not all facilities offer this).
Requirements: May have to be able to walk independently, although these residences usually will accept people using walkers and wheelchairs; may have to be able to transfer from bed or chair independently (except hospice patients). Special waivers may be required by state licensing for hospice care or dementia care.
Costs: Often lower than other facilities. Qualifies for long-term care insurance. In states with Medicaid 1915c waivers (HCBS waiver), the cost may be covered for those who qualify for Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California). Supplemental Security Income (SSI) covers the cost for Board and Care Facilities for certain conditions, such mental health patients and people with developmental disabilities. Medicare does not pay. Veteran Administration (VA) may pay.
Advantages: Hospice waiver, dementia waiver will allow a facility to provide specialized care. Smaller, home-like setting is good for residents who don’t like or need a lot of activity, but would thrive with more personal attention.
Disadvantages: May require the resident to transfer independently from bed to chair, etc., and not all have awake staff at night. The environment might not be as stimulating and varied as in a larger facility. May not offer transportation service to medical appointments or other places.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/residential-care-options-housing-options/,Residential Care Options: Housing Options,"Also known as Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly (RCFE).
Non-medical facility, larger than a Board and Care, with a building built especially for this purpose with up to several hundred residents. Most facilities offer levels of care, such as independent living, assisted living, and/or memory care unit. Rooms may be studio or one/two bedroom apartments. May or may not have cooking facilities. Each state has different regulations for what is and is not provided. Some are owned by for-profit businesses and others are owned by not-for-profit organizations. The ownership can have an impact on the culture of the residence. Service can vary greatly, so be sure to look beyond the attractive physical appearance of the building and grounds to confirm that the resident care services you need and desire are provided in a high quality manner.
Provides: Meals, social and recreational activities, housekeeping, laundry, some transportation (often to doctors, shopping, outings, etc.), medication management, 24-hour supervision.
Options: Most facilities either have levels of care or a “cafeteria” plan to accommodate changes in care needs. Either way, there is an additional charge for personal care, administering medication, assistance in getting to activities or meals, etc. Residents can receive a higher level of care as needed without moving to a different facility, unless medical needs require skilled nursing.
Requirements: May have to be able to walk independently or with a walking aid. Most accept wheelchairs. Usually need to be able to transfer from chair to bed or similar independently.
Costs: There is a base rate for the kind of room that is rented, such as a studio. There is often a one-time admission fee which is often equivalent to the monthly facility charge. There are additional charges for added services. Memory care has a higher base rate. Qualifies for long- term care insurance. In states with Medicaid 1915c waivers (HCBS waiver), the cost may be covered for those who qualify for Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California). Medicare does not pay. VA may pay.
Advantages: Works well for couples where the care needs may be different for each person. Provides socialization and a community so that residents don’t become isolated in their own homes. Most care needs can be provided in the facility. Often have a specialized section for memory/dementia care. Help is always available. Hospice care is allowed in the facility.
Disadvantages: Large facility might be overwhelming and transition to new place might be harder. Takes longer to integrate into the community and find appropriate social relationships. Costs can be high depending on the community and the amount of care needed. Yearly fee increases are to be expected.",[]

SNFs provide care for individuals who need nursing care, but don’t need to be in a hospital. These are medical facilities with 24-hour nursing supervision, with a requirement that there be at least one RN on duty at all times. SNFs are able to help with complex medical treatment such as feeding tubes, ventilators, oxygen, wound care, injections (such as insulin) or IV medications, as well as care for someone who is bed-bound.
Provides: Rooms are similar to a hospital with one to three beds per room. Meals are provided as well as some social activities. For individuals needing rehabilitation, there are trained occupational and physical therapists on staff (Patients are often discharged to a SNF for short-term rehabilitation after hospitalization. This is usually covered by insurance.) Nursing care and personal care are provided at all times. Medications and more complex medical care provided.
Options: For a higher cost, an individual can have a single room. Therapies can continue if paid for privately after insurance coverage ends. There is a daily rate for patient care after insurance deems no more “skilled care” is needed (something that requires a professional to do).
Requirements: Facilities vary on what higher level of medical care is provided, for example, not all skilled nursing facilities will accept ventilators or feeding tubes.
Costs: Nursing homes are the most expensive form of care. If a private room is desired, the cost is also much higher. Medicare will pay for rehabilitation for a maximum of 100 days after a hospitalization as long as there are skilled needs, e.g. ongoing physical therapy or certain medical procedures. Most stays for rehab are two to three weeks. Medicaid will pay for an individual to be in a nursing home indefinitely if they have ongoing care needs. Long-term care insurance and the VA also can be accessed to help cover part of the cost of nursing home care. Note: Not all nursing homes accept Medicaid. Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance cover on a short term basis for rehabilitation. The VA has SNFs in some locations where veterans can get ongoing care.
Advantages: If resident qualifies for Medicaid, then costs for care are covered. All medical care is provided without the need to find additional care if health declines.
Disadvantages: More institutional setting with other residents also more disabled, so these facilities may seem depressing.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/residential-care-options-right-time/,Residential Care Options: The Right Time,"Most caregivers are committed to keeping a frail or ill loved one at home as long as possible. Maybe they promised not to put the care receiver in a “nursing home”—the worst fear of many adults living with a debilitating illness. But there are many reasons why moving to residential care outside the home is not only necessary, but also the right thing to do. It is, however, a very difficult decision. Caregivers often struggle to care for a care receiver, waiting too long and compromising their own physical and emotional well-being, making the move even harder. There is not a “right” time—it is when you are ready or circumstances require it.
The decision to move your relative to a care residence is a very personal family decision. There are no clear-cut guidelines or answers for making this decision. Studies show that the main reasons for moving a loved one are: the need for more skilled care (tube feeding, wound care, intravenous medication, etc.); the health of the caregiver (back trouble, depression, cancer, etc.); dementia-related behaviors (such as exit seeking, sleeplessness, combativeness); need for more assistance (transferring, incontinence care, etc.); and debilitating mental health issues.
Other common reasons include discomfort with personal care (e.g. an adult child faced with incontinence care for his mother); fecal incontinence; lack of sleep; or the feeling that the care recipient no longer knows who you are. The change also may come after a hospitalization or medical crisis of the care receiver or caregiver, or when care plans change, such as when a loved one is no longer able to attend adult day care, or you are not able to find an appropriate home care assistant to hire.
When the level of care needed is so high that you, as caregiver, feel a sense of failure or inadequacy, when your physical or mental health is at risk, or when there are no rewards left for you in caregiving, then it may be time to consider moving your loved one.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/residential-care-options-right-time/,Residential Care Options: The Right Time,"Be informed—don’t wait for a crisis or until you are totally burned out. Plan ahead, learn about options, explore choices in your community. This will increase your decision making control.
 Have a family meeting—with or without the care recipient. Talk honestly about the situation. Consider what each person has observed and what each person is willing to do to help. Be clear about all the caregiving tasks and responsibilities. Is hiring in-home help an option? What can be done if there is family conflict over the decision? (See FCA Fact Sheets: Holding a Family Meeting, and Hiring In-Home Help).
 Get support—from family, friends, extended family. It is hard to make this decision on your own and feel that you have all the responsibility for the decision. It may be hard to admit to your own limitations.
 Attend a support group or get counseling. Meeting with a counselor skilled in helping caregivers is known to help with decision making and reduce caregiver burden.
 If the care recipient is able to understand and participate in decision making, talk with them about your limitations—what you can and cannot do. Balance the positive and negatives for you and your loved one. Placement in a facility may be in the best interest of both of you.
 Discuss money openly so that a decision is made consistent with what the financial situation is for the care receiver. Explore options such as Medicaid. (See FCA Fact Sheet What Every Caregiver Needs to Know About Money)
 Try a respite stay—many facilities will allow someone to stay for a week or two to “try it out.”
 What is your bottom line—at what point would you feel you could have your loved one in a facility without feeling guilty? Everyone has their own turning points; they are neither wrong nor right.
 Feelings—this is hard. But difficult doesn’t mean wrong.
Guilt—means you did something wrong. Moving to a facility may be the best decision for the health and safety of the care receiver, as well as for you. Putting yourself first and taking care of your needs is not selfish. If you made a promise not to place your loved one, know that you made that promise at a time when you did not know what the future care needs would be. It was true at the time, but things change.
Feelings of ambivalence are natural—wanting to take care of someone and also wanting it to be over.
Regret—that you are in this situation and have to make this decision. It is not your fault; it is no one’s fault. Accept that you can’t control the disease or the course of the illness.
Grief—over loss of how you would have wanted life to be for you and your loved-one, loss of your role as primary caregiver, potential loss of your control and responsibility.
Sadness—it’s ok to cry and feel bad about the decision, but still know it is right and what needs to happen.
Fear—that your loved one won’t be taken care of the way you take care of him or her. This is true. He or she will be taken care of differently and will have someone who comes to work each day fresh and has the energy to be a caregiver, rather than you—perhaps exhausted and burned out, or maybe ill yourself. But you are the one who loves him/her and no one can replace that.
Thinking that going to a facility means he/she will die (sooner)—that it is a death sentence. But question your negative thoughts. Recognize it is regret and possibly guilt you are feeling.
Uncertainty—and second guessing. Did I make the right decision? Could I have continued to care at home? Is this the right place for my loved one? What will I do when I am no longer a caregiver? Do I have a right to enjoy myself?
Responsibility vs. Obligation vs. Love—all of these emotions play a part. Try to sort out which is influencing your decision.
  Special Concerns when the care receiver has dementia:
Caregivers are more stressed.
Long-term nature of illness makes it more difficult to decide when it is the right time.
Anger/frustration are common—at behaviors, at the illness, at the medical system.
Safety for yourself and for the person with dementia.
Finding the right facility takes more consideration.
Guilt—means you did something wrong. Moving to a facility may be the best decision for the health and safety of the care receiver, as well as for you. Putting yourself first and taking care of your needs is not selfish. If you made a promise not to place your loved one, know that you made that promise at a time when you did not know what the future care needs would be. It was true at the time, but things change.

Sadness—it’s ok to cry and feel bad about the decision, but still know it is right and what needs to happen.
Fear—that your loved one won’t be taken care of the way you take care of him or her. This is true. He or she will be taken care of differently and will have someone who comes to work each day fresh and has the energy to be a caregiver, rather than you—perhaps exhausted and burned out, or maybe ill yourself. But you are the one who loves him/her and no one can replace that.
Thinking that going to a facility means he/she will die (sooner)—that it is a death sentence. But question your negative thoughts. Recognize it is regret and possibly guilt you are feeling.
Uncertainty—and second guessing. Did I make the right decision? Could I have continued to care at home? Is this the right place for my loved one? What will I do when I am no longer a caregiver? Do I have a right to enjoy myself?
Responsibility vs. Obligation vs. Love—all of these emotions play a part. Try to sort out which is influencing your decision.

 Do not go on outings until your loved one is totally adjusted to their living situation, and then only if you think it would be helpful and not confusing.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/resources-discount-medications/,Resources for Discount Medications,"Caregivers everywhere are familiar with the high-wire act involved in paying for medications for a loved one in their care. Already working within tight budgets, families find it difficult to absorb recent increases in prescription costs. Carol Thomson, for example, pays $700-800 a month for her mother’s medications, and even though a small grant helped cover the cost over the past year, the grant is about to run out. So far, she has made 30 or 40 phone calls in an attempt to find discounted medications. Fortunately, a few generous physicians have helped her with free samples.
Caregiver Lucille Marinko will be forced to give up the attendant care which affords her a little respite time, because she is unable to pay for both the eight medications she needs for her mother and the additional help.
As we know, Medicare does not cover the cost of prescription medicines. For a while, Medicare supplemental policies—in particular the HMO policies—did cover prescriptions to a greater or lesser extent—sometimes with a cap on how much could be spent each year, sometimes with a given amount for co-pay, and sometimes with options for using generic medications.
However, because prescription costs are the largest cause of the increase in the cost of medical care in the United States—rising at twice the rate of inflation—most insurance companies have put limits on their coverage. Congress continues to debate different prescription coverage programs for Medicare recipients. Meanwhile, caregivers continue to scramble to find money to pay for drugs as well as the myriad other expenses involved in caring for someone with a long-term illness.
Often the people struggling to pay for these medications don’t meet traditional low-income guidelines to qualify for Medi-Cal. When people do qualify for Medi-Cal, the cost of their medications is covered as long as the medications they require are on the formulary (list of approved drugs). When a complicated illness is involved, however, even Medi-Cal eligible patients may need medications not covered by the Medi-Cal formulary. A physician can apply to Medi-Cal for an exemption for his patient; however, the process is time-consuming. Others eligible for Medi-Cal must pay a share of cost approximately equal to their out-of-pocket expenses, leaving a minimal amount each month to live on.
Those not eligible for Medi-Cal face an even more daunting process, as one often must apply to each pharmaceutical company separately, and each company has different criteria to qualify for lower prices.
As the government and insurance companies struggle with this problem, some help is available—although it may take access to a computer and considerable time to find the right program.
Help on the Web
Many people are unaware that pharmacies that accept Medi-Cal are required to charge the Medi-Cal rate for prescriptions to people on Medicare. You can find the Medi-Cal rate for the top 50 drugs at: www.dhs.ca.gov/mcs/mcpd/MBB/contracting/sb393.
The easiest way to review the kinds of programs drug companies offer is to visit www.needymeds.com.
A new drug savings card called Together Rx is now available. It offers a 20-40% discount on the cost of medications. See www.togetherrx.com.
The Medicine Program, www.themedicineprogram.com, helps people find assistance in obtaining medications, as does the Directory of Prescription Drug Assistance Programs, www.phrma.org.
AARP has a mail order prescription program that gives discounts on medications. See www.aarppharmacy.com.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/sara-kruse-going-extra-mile/,Sara Kruse: Going the Extra Mile,"At FCA, we always need help with mailings, filing, organizing the library, tabulating survey results and sorting out our many materials, so when Sara Kruse approached FCA’s Program Director Donna Schempp to ask if we needed volunteer help, we were thrilled.
Sara started coming to the office once a week and soon became invaluable to the workings of FCA. She has helped us for the past three years, but she is now moving to the Northernmost part of California, and will be sorely missed around the office.
Before she left, Sara related  her story of caregiving. She was formerly a client of FCA’s. She says that the support she received helped her to get through the challenges of caring for her mother, and that is why she wanted to give back through volunteer work. Many of the themes of her story will resonate with others of you who are also family caregivers.
Sara and her brother cared for her mother for many years and through varying illnesses before dementia set in. Finally, her behavior became difficult to deal with and Sara went to help her brother, who had been the primary caregiver for her mother. Problems multiplied and after her mother actually ate a thermometer, she ended up in the hospital. While there, her mother fell and broke her pelvis and then developed congestive heart failure. Sara soon learned that patients who have dementia need their families to be on constant alert to make sure their loved ones get proper care in the hospital. It was then that Sara realized that her mother was going to need full-time care and moved her mother to California to live with her. Over the next few years, her mother became incontinent, had compression fractures due to osteoporosis, and was agitated due to her dementia.
Although dealing with her own disability, Sara took on the care of her mother for two years, and continued to care for her for another year in a nursing home after her mother broke her thigh and was unable to walk again. As when her mother was in the hospital, she found her mother needed a constant advocate in the nursing home to guarantee she was well cared for.
During that time, Sara experienced some common consequences of caregiving. She said the first thing was that she ran up credit card debt in order to cover her own expenses while caring for her mother. Her brother helped with some finances, which meant he was unable to retire as they needed his earning power to cover the bills.
Second, she developed stress-related illnesses, such as high blood pressure, weight gain, depression, stomach distress and disturbed sleep. Meanwhile, she was still having surgeries for her own disability. Navigating the maze of getting Medi-Cal for her mother when she went to the nursing home, she says, was another nightmare.
Like others who have had to put their lives on hold while caregiving, Sara has had to deal with paying very high premiums for health insurance. After her COBRA plan expired, she had to use the California Major Medical Plan, and her monthly insurance costs rose from $380 per month to more than $900 per month. Having a pre-existing condition makes getting medical insurance very difficult if you are not working for a company. Also, she did not pay into social security during that time, thus reducing her monthly social security income now that she is 65.
There are a few things Sara feels all caregivers go through. The first is guilt. She says she can still remember all those little things she didn’t do right, and the times that she was impatient and blamed herself for her mother’s problems.
Second is isolation. Sara says all caregivers need help, whether from family, friends or other social supports. Caregivers don’t need to protect others from their complaints—sometimes complaining is very therapeutic.
Third is support. This means not being criticized by others, having others help in the caregiving and just getting understanding. Respite care is also a part of this. Luckily, Sara and her brother worked well together—but Sara knows this isn’t true for all families.
As Sara moves into her new home near the ocean, we wish her tranquility and good health. We thank her for her expert skills, her sense of humor and her willingness to tackle any task. We were fortunate in having someone who not only was familiar with the challenges of caregiving, but with the challenges of office work too! And we are actively searching for volunteers to fill the space left by her absence.
If you are interested in contributing your office skills to FCA, we’d love to talk to you! Please call A.J. Dugay at (800) 445-8106.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/saying-yes-offers-help/,Saying ‘Yes’ to Offers of Help,"How do you respond when someone asks, “Is there anything I can do?” More likely than not, your response is, “Oh no, I’m okay.” And when friends say “Let me know if I can help you,” do you call them?
It is sometimes difficult to say we need help—so we don’t. Learning to say “yes” to such offers is really a gift you give to yourself as well as to the person who offers. It’s simple, really: People feel good when they do something nice for someone else. And when they help by providing respite and assistance in a caregiving situation, it’s even better.
Caregivers may be reluctant to accept help, because they feel they should be able to handle everything themselves. They may feel that caring for a loved one is their responsibility—and theirs alone. Or perhaps they’re afraid something will happen while they are away from their loved one. Some might think that accepting help is a sign of failure or selfishness—that you’re enjoying yourself when your loved one can’t any more. We often think that our loved ones can’t get along without us. Or we don’t want to burden others with our cares.
But the fact of the matter is that breaks and support during the caregiving journey are a must. They reduce burnout, help you to be more patient with loved ones, and can even prevent premature placement in a nursing home.
As you approach your relatives and friends, remember that it is better to ask for help directly than to hint. And it’s much better to do so before you are desperate (when hearing “no” would be really hard).
Often caregivers don’t know what to say when someone offers help. To start, you will be more successful if you match the request with a particular talent or interest of the person who is offering. For example, if someone likes to cook, suggest meals.
Post a task list on the refrigerator or attach it to the calendar or another easily visible location. When someone asks you if they can help, refer to your list and say “YES.” Let them choose what task on the list they would like to do.
You don’t need to feel indebted to those who help—your sincere appreciation of their help is thanks enough. People understand that you may not be able to return the favor. Little remembrances such as flowers or sweets let people know you care. Learning to receive graciously is a talent we all need to develop.
To make it easier to say “yes,” here’s some language to use, and a list of things to say “yes” to:
Read a book to my loved one, watch TV with my father, listen to music with my Mom, entertain my husband so I can have a break
Help us in the garden: mow the lawn, pull weeds
Go shopping for me, or pick up a few items for me when you’re at the grocery store 
Run errands like dropping off the dry cleaning, picking up pharmacy prescriptions, returning books or videos to the library, or taking mail to the post office
Drive to an appointment
Be available for talking—help me to laugh and have perspective on my situation
Call once a week to let me have adult conversation about anything other than caregiving
Help with a project—it’s always easier to do things with someone else’s encouragement
Stay with my loved one so I can go to religious services, take a nap, attend a support group, go to a doctor’s appointment, get a haircut, get a massage
Go to lunch with me or a movie, take a walk with me and help me get some exercise
Walk the dog or take my pet to the vet
Do research on the Internet about new treatments
Call and find out about local resources
Sort the mail, throw out junk mail
Wash the car or get some gas
Give a haircut to my grandfather, or a manicure to my aunt
Help me fill in forms, deal with medical insurance issues
Stay with Dad once a month for four hours so I can do whatever I want

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/seeking-elusive-good-night-sleep/,Seeking That Elusive Good Night Sleep,"Americans are more sleep-deprived than people in other countries. According to the National Sleep Foundation, most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night for optimum performance, health, and safety. The Foundation advises: “When we don’t get adequate sleep, we accumulate a sleep debt that can be difficult to “pay back” if it becomes too big. The resulting sleep deprivation has been linked to health problems such as obesity and high blood pressure, negative mood and behavior, decreased productivity, and safety issues in the home, on the job, and on the road.”
Caregivers often find themselves exhausted at the end of the day, but many are still not able to sleep. Varying studies have documented that approximately 70% of caregivers for people with dementia report sleep problems, 60% report sleeping less than 7 hours, and 10-20% use alcohol to go to sleep and/or sleep medication. In data collected by the California Caregiver Resource Centers, 41% of caregivers said they are awakened during the night by the care receiver. These same caregivers also scored higher on the depression screening.
Insomnia comes in several forms—trouble falling asleep (more than 30 minutes), trouble falling back asleep after waking at night (e.g. to use the bathroom or care for someone else), waking up early and not being able to fall back asleep, or waking up not feeling refreshed. People with depression and anxiety also have a higher incidence of insomnia.
People with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias frequently have sleep disturbances. The most common is “sundowning,” so called because the person gets agitated later in the day and often has trouble falling asleep and/or staying asleep once in bed. This leads, of course, to lack of sleep in caregivers, and is one of the most common reasons for a caregiver to place a care receiver in a facility. Lack of sleep also makes people irritable and impatient, which makes caregiving even harder.
It is important to talk with your loved one’s physician about sleep disturbances. This is as important for your loved one as it is for you and your health. You might consider a night time attendant or ask for respite help at night, so you can get sleep. Medications might help also. A rule of thumb is that you need a good night’s sleep every third night to prevent burn-out.
There are a number of ways to help yourself get a good night’s sleep. Getting exercise everyday is good for you in every way, but in particular, it helps with sleep and in reducing depression. Having a regular sleep routine—one that is calming, e.g. taking a bath or reading—and a regular bedtime are also important. Having a room that is dark, quiet and a little cool, and not eating a big meal before going to sleep, make a big difference. We all know to cut down on caffeine (and don’t forget many sodas contain caffeine), and also that alcohol may help you fall asleep, but may actually contribute to waking up during the night.
The National Institutes of Health have published a free booklet called “Your Guide to Healthy Sleep” which can be downloaded from their website, www.nih.gov or by writing to National Institutes of Health (NIH), 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892.

Getting a good night’s sleep is not only necessary in order for you to take care of yourself, it is also necessary in terms of the quality of care you give your loved one. It should go at the top of your priority list instead of at the bottom where we usually find it!",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/sexuality-and-dementia/,Sexuality and Dementia,"How has your relationship with your partner changed as a result of disease? Physicians seem reluctant to address this question with caregivers dealing with a long-term chronic illness.
“No one asked me about my marriage or sexuality. Yet it plays a large part in our well being. No one asked me, ʻwhat’s the quality of your life?ʼ … I’m a sexual individual. I’m 76 years old and Iʼm still alive,” said Jerry, who cared for his wife with dementia.
At a recent conference of the Caregiver Resource Centers of California, the keynote presentation was on sexuality and intimacy. At this presentation, there was a panel of caregivers who shared their experiences caring for their loved ones. As the audience of professionals listened, the moderator asked each one if anyone had ever asked them how the disease had affected their ability to be intimate. Each one, in turn, said that the subject had never come up with any professional, not even in a caregiver support group. Outside of the issue of disease, our society as a whole tends to deny the sexuality of sick and/or older people.
Dementia, diabetes, Parkinsonʼs, and stroke, to name a few diseases, can affect the ability of someone to perform sexually. Coupled with that, the medications that people are taking can also adversely effect sexual functioning. Although the incidence of a heart attack or stroke caused by sexual activity is extremely low, this is often a fear. One person shared that sex wasnʼt gratifying; it was less frequent and more awkward. People may experience changes in arousal patterns and in the way in which sexual desires are manifested. There is often guilt and anger about not being able to meet the sexual needs of oneʼs partner and feelings of rejection if the caregiver doesnʼt respond.
Being sexual in a relationship is part of how we have a sense of closeness and intimacy. “It was very comforting; there were periods when we were very anxious, devastated, scared… and being sexual with each other was real important. It became a time of connecting, a time of reassurance, a time of pleasure, it was a time when things felt normal when nothing else felt normal. Our life was unraveling and being sexual with each other was a time that felt good.”
The loss of the sexual relationship is a major part of the grief and sense of loss that caregivers experience while caring for a loved one. If the caregiver is tired and exhausted, frustrated and confused, it is hard to feel sexually attractive. “I became more of a caregiver and less of a romantic partner; itʼs very hard to be sexual when you are acting like the mother,” said Ann. Anger and guilt can lead to not feeling good about oneʼs self, which can make it hard to feel sexual arousal.
The caregiver has another dilemma in wondering if he/she is taking advantage of a loved one when initiating sex, particularly when it is difficult to determine if this is a consensual act. Caregivers wonder if they are being selfish and irresponsible if they attend to their own sexual needs through masturbation or pursuing a sexual relationship outside the marriage. One caregiver shared that she sometimes has sex with her husband as a way to calm him down when he is agitated. But sex without passion or emotional connection can leave the caregiver feeling degraded.
Some people with dementia become hypersexual and need medication to decrease their sex drive. Inappropriate overtures to a nonspouse, verbal obscenities, and undressing in public are behaviors that may cause significant concern and challenges. When the spouse is exhibiting these behaviors, caregivers can find themselves even less willing sexual partners.
Each couple has to find ways that work for them to experience intimacy when disease changes the relationship. The history of how problems have been resolved in the past and how intimacy was expressed will affect how to cope under these circumstances. “…I realized how much I was losing, I realized how important it was, and I realized it didnʼt have to be over for me. My husband at this point was still interested and it was me who was turning off…. Part of our lovemaking had always been being intimate and talking and sharing…and he would listen, but that part was going…. I had to do some real attitude shifts and I had to make a lot of adjustments….”
It may be possible to explore other ways to express intimacy and ways to enjoy nonverbal expressions of closeness. Acknowledging and mourning the loss is important. Joyce said, “Once the diagnosis came through, we had a period of great tenderness in our relationship—affection, holding, being able to look at each other deeply was very special. As time has gone on that has really shifted, my partner has become much more withdrawn.”
Caregivers have found support by talking with physicians, therapists, social workers, and clergy. “The doctor didnʼt help me at all, except he listened…professionals don’t have to have answers or give advice, but just listen. He provided a safe space and he gave me permission to talk about this. What happened for me is that a light went on about an area of my life that I didnʼt want to think about. I realized how much I was losing….”

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/siblings-and-caregiving/,Siblings and Caregiving,"The doctor has informed you that your mother can no longer live independently. You feel that assisted living would be the best solution but your sister strongly disagrees. It seemed that at one time you were able to communicate with her, but not any longer . . . .
Ideally, providing care for an elderly parent would be a time of family unity and mutual support among siblings. Although this might be the case for some adult siblings, for many others, eldercare brings about painful conflict, and is an issue that our Family Consultants at FCA deal with frequently.
Discord among siblings can have devastating effects on family relations as well as cause unneeded strain on caregivers. In a study of women caring for parents with de-mentia, siblings were cited as the most important source of interpersonal stress (J. Jill Suitor of Louisiana State University and Karl Pillemer of Cornell University, 1994).
Although each family is unique, there are common underlying causes that can lead to friction between adult children. Often, the first close interactions that siblings have had since childhood are brought about through eldercare.
Old wounds and past rivalries will undoubtedly come into play during this time, making compromise about care decisions especially challenging. It is not uncommon for adult children to regress to childhood roles, where suddenly siblings are competing for mom’s affection or tallying up how many chores each has completed.
Elderly parents can unintentionally contribute to this regression by favoring one sibling over the other; many times focusing their attention on the child who is actually the least involved in their care. Often, the anger and frustration that they are feeling towards their own dependency will cause them to lash out at the child who is providing the day-to-day care and representative of their lost independence.
Most often, the spark that will trigger sibling feuding is the unequal distribution of responsibility. Even in large families with multiple siblings, there is almost always one adult child who will take on the majority of the care-giving duties. Whether this role is taken on because of geographic proximity, age, or emotional ties, it is certain that the primary caregiver will feel some resentment for doing so much and other siblings will feel shut out.
Many adult children will unknowingly place themselves in the role of primary caregiver by slowly taking on more and more tasks for an elderly parent. Soon, a pattern is set in which the primary caregiver is responsible for all aspects of a parent’s care. Changing this pattern can be difficult and it is best to get siblings involved early on. A primary caregiver who is trying to encourage sibling participation should remember these tips:
Keep siblings informed about an elderly parent’s condition and care plan.
Listen to siblings’ opinions concerning care decisions and be willing to compromise.
Let siblings know that their help really is wanted and needed.
Ask siblings to take care of specific tasks. Even siblings that live across the country can help by making check-in phone calls or locating services.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/siblings-and-caregiving/,Siblings and Caregiving,"Set an agenda for the meeting and keep to it.
Focus on the “here and now.” Try not to bring up past or unrelated issues.
Share your feelings with siblings instead of making accusations.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/special-concerns-lgbt-caregivers/,Special Concerns of LGBTQ+ Caregivers,"As Americans live longer, greater attention is being paid to the concerns facing aging adults and caregivers. While many issues are the same for all older adults and those who care for them, some unique considerations arise for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBTQ+) people dealing with aging.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/special-concerns-lgbt-caregivers/,Special Concerns of LGBTQ+ Caregivers,"As you may already know, many LGBTQ+ people form strong “families of choice” in addition to their families of origin as a way of coping with possible or actual rejection by parents, siblings, and other relatives for being open about their sexual orientation or gender identity. Even as attitudes have changed and LGBTQ+ people have become more visible and accepted, families of choice still provide invaluable networks of emotional and social support. Nearly two-thirds of LGBTQ+ older adults say they consider their friends to be chosen family.
Being a member of both a chosen family and a family of origin creates situations where an LGBTQ+ person may become a primary caregiver for a spouse, domestic partner, or legal spouse, a close friend who is also LGBTQ+, or an aging parent or other relative—sometimes simultaneously. In the community at large, it is most common for informal caregivers such as spouses and adult children to provide the majority of care to older adults in the United States. In the LGBTQ+ community—with older adults twice as likely to be single and living alone, and three to four times less likely to have children—a family of choice is depended upon to provide support and care.
In January 2011, federal regulations took effect allowing patients at most hospitals in the country to decide who has visitation rights and who can make medical decisions on their behalf, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or family makeup. President Obama issued a presidential memorandum on hospital visitation that called for “appropriate rulemaking … to ensure that hospitals that participate in Medicare or Medicaid respect the rights of patients to designate visitors.” The memorandum recommended that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services provide detailed guidelines for hospital visitation that prohibit discrimination based on “race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.” These protections are further reinforced in the Affordable Care Act. But as you will see in the news, instances occur where some hospital personnel remain confused or continue to deny health care proxies to same-sex couples. For more information on health care visitation rights and decision making, see resources available from the Human Rights Campaign.
It is also important for LGBTQ+ seniors and their caregivers to complete basic legal documents establishing the right to make care decisions and to document treatment preferences for hospital and healthcare providers. (See the FCA fact sheet Legal Issues for LGBTQ+ Caregivers.)",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/special-concerns-lgbt-caregivers/,Special Concerns of LGBTQ+ Caregivers,"Another concern that some LGBTQ+ caregivers face is scheduling time off with their employer to care for an aging loved one. Time off can range from occasional doctor visits to extended unpaid leave to be with someone who is more seriously ill. This concern may be further complicated by the degree to which you are “out” at work, and whether your employer has a nondiscrimination policy that affirms LGBTQ+ people and offers domestic-partner benefits.
Ask your human resources department for written copies of your company’s policies and benefits. Discuss any concerns with your manager or boss. If you are not “out” to your employer or do not feel comfortable discussing personal issues with your manager or HR department, seek referrals for legal advice from local or nearby LGBTQ+ organizations, the National Center for Lesbian Rights (available to all LGBTQ+ people), or Lambda Legal.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act—which requires most companies to offer employees at least 12 weeks unpaid leave to care for ailing family members—does not provide job protection to LGBTQ+ (or unmarried heterosexual) domestic partners. However, many private employers, including more than half of Fortune 500 companies, now offer domestic partners the same medical leave and bereavement policies as married employees. Public employees also enjoy these benefits in cities and states where domestic partner benefits are offered, as do employees of some federal agencies.
In California, workers who contribute to the State Disability Insurance (SDI) fund are entitled Paid Family Leave for up to eight weeks in a 12-month period when employees need to take time off work to care for a seriously ill spouse, domestic partner, child, parent, parent-in-law, grandparent, grandchild or sibling or to bond with a new child. Workers may receive up to 55% of their weekly wages up to a maximum weekly benefit amount (determined by weekly wages in the base period). 
Some states may provide registered domestic partners and same-sex spouses with the right to receive unemployment benefits when they leave a job position to join their partner at a new location where commuting is impractical and a job transfer is not available. Although it will vary by state, in California, this benefit is not charged to the employerʼs account.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/special-concerns-lgbt-caregivers/,Special Concerns of LGBTQ+ Caregivers,"As a caregiver, the time may come when you need additional support to provide proper care for your loved one. Paid care is available at nearly every stage along the continuum of care, from in-home service to residential assisted-living to skilled nursing facilities. Entrusting the care of a loved one to a stranger can be a difficult decision—one that can be compounded by fear of inadequate treatment or discrimination for being LGBTQ+. Too often, LGBTQ+ older adults can allow this fear to postpone seeking assistance or support—which further increases isolation and decreases mental and physical health.
For these reasons, it is important to do some preliminary research on in-home care and support and other community resources that are available before discussing it with the person for whom you are providing care. Having answers at the ready will help ease concerns that your partner, spouse, or friend may raise, and will better allow you to move forward with a plan for additional care.
The best source for information about service providers is firsthand knowledge from other LGBTQ+ people you know. Ask friends and work colleagues with similar circumstances for referrals to LGBTQ+-affirming healthcare and service providers with whom they have worked, and discuss what they liked and didn’t like about their care. Make notes about specific departments and people they considered to be strong allies.
Similarly, local or nearby LGBTQ+ community centers, LGBTQ+ health organizations, and LGBTQ+ senior advocacy groups can provide excellent referrals and support. You may also consider reaching out to HIV/AIDS service organizations for a list of LGBTQ+-affirming home healthcare providers. Another option is to contact the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association, which offers referrals to LGBTQ+-sensitive medical professionals in many parts of the country. Lastly, you may want to see which, if any, senior service providers advertise in local LGBTQ+ publications or websites in your area. This can be a good first sign that an agency or organization has experience with and ties to the community.
Once you have a list of providers, review their websites and literature. Are LGBTQ+ couples represented in images? Do they use inclusive words such as domestic partner, significant other and life partner as well as spouse? Do they describe a broad definition of family? Is there a stated nondiscrimination policy that specifically affirms the rights of LGBTQ+ people? Call agencies and ask about their policies directly. Ask them how many LGBTQ+ clients they work with currently and what steps they have taken to create a welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ seniors.
For most people, the price of care will factor heavily into decisions about bringing on additional support. Through each state’s Medicaid program (MediCal in California), a number of services, such as adult day healthcare and in-home assistance, may be funded to support those needing care. Some states have “consumer-directed” in-home support-service programs, which allow aging adults with disabilities to hire and supervise a paid support worker with whom they feel comfortable. In many states with consumer direction, spouses are restricted from being hired to provide paid care. In this case, for LGBTQ+ caregivers, non-married same-sex couples can hire their partner to provide care.
You will find it much easier to work with and obtain information from Social Security, Medicaid/Medi-Cal, and other service providers if the person for whom you are caring has completed certain standard legal documents that designate you to act on his or her behalf. Even if you and your loved one currently have an understanding with certain physicians or care staff, it is still important to take these legal steps. In an emergency, you may have to deal with doctors and other professionals outside your regular care network who will not provide medical information to individuals who are not next of kin or who are not legally designated to make decisions on behalf of the patient. (See the FCA fact sheet Legal Issues for LGBTQ+ Caregivers.)
Depending on where you live, your expectations for finding LGBTQ+-affirming care and support may vary widely. In cities with visibly large LGBTQ+ communities, you may find that older LGBTQ+ people have formed their own social and support organizations, and that there are dedicated LGBTQ+ medical clinics, assisted-living facilities, and retirement communities. In many other cities and towns, senior care providers may not know that they have worked with LGBTQ+ aging adults or why a person’s sexual orientation is even relevant. (Unfortunately, unless providers receive training on reaching and serving LGBTQ+ caregivers and their families, their needs may remain largely invisible.) Continue seeking referrals from friends, colleagues, and local and national LGBTQ+ organizations until you feel good about working with a provider.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/special-concerns-lgbt-caregivers/,Special Concerns of LGBTQ+ Caregivers,"A recent survey of LGBTQ+ baby boomers found that a growing number of LGBTQ+ aging adults expect to be treated with respect and dignity at the end of their life. In spite of this, one in five of the LGBTQ+ adults surveyed cited fear of double discrimination (for being older and LGBTQ+), as a significant concern about aging. These fears are particularly important to seniors moving into nursing homes or residential care facilities. Unfortunately, 41 states do not currently have any housing or public accommodations laws prohibiting discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation.
Homophobia can be expressed in different ways in a care facility, ranging from comments made to your spouse, partner, or friend by other patients or staff, to problems with the care that is or should be provided. Under the law, all residents have rights and protections. The facility must publicly list and provide a copy of these rights to all new residents. (Read more about them at: https://www.medicare.gov/what-medicare-covers/what-part-a-covers/skilled-nursing-facility-rights.)
If problems occur, the first step in resolving the issue is to determine whether the mistreatment is the behavior of an individual or part of a larger pattern of behavior within the facility. If the harassment is by another resident, possibly a roommate, ask if your loved one can be moved to another room or part of the facility. If the problem stems from an individual health worker or aide, talk to the appropriate supervisor or administrator and ask if another staff person can be assigned to assist your partner, spouse, or friend. If problems persist or if you determine that the homophobia is widespread and can’t be resolved by talking with the facility staff, you should contact your local Ombudsman Program.
Under federal law, each jurisdiction must maintain an Ombudsman Program that will rapidly verify claims of mistreatment or abuse in licensed care facilities and help to mediate problem resolution. Local Ombudsman Programs also should be responsive to caregivers who want to discuss their concerns about care in a licensed facility and assist in determining if a complaint should be filed. Contact the Office on Aging or the Area Agency on Aging in the county in which the facility is located to get information about your local Ombudsman Program. You can also report a problem directly to the state department (often the State Department of Health) that licenses and/or certifies skilled nursing facilities (sometimes known as nursing homes), residential care facilities, or board and care homes.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/special-concerns-lgbt-caregivers/,Special Concerns of LGBTQ+ Caregivers,"Some older LGBTQ+ adults report feeling disconnected from or invisible to the larger LGBTQ+ community as they age. In our youth-focused culture, institutionalized ageism produces these feelings among heterosexual older adults as well. As an LGBTQ+ caregiver, it can be important to help the person for whom you care stay connected to members of your chosen family and to other LGBTQ+ older people.
As LGBTQ+ people age and depend on others for care, they may become more guarded about who they are. While this choice is understandable, one consequence can be greater feelings of isolation. Also, since LGBTQ+ seniors are more likely to be single and to live alone, extra efforts may be needed to build and maintain social support networks. Ask local LGBTQ+ organizations about regular social events for LGBTQ+ seniors in your area, or about the availability of an LGBTQ+-friendly visitor program. Seek out multigenerational community activities such as bingo nights, film festivals, and neighborhood fairs, as ways to stay connected to the community at large. Patronize local cafes and bookstores where LGBTQ+ people congregate. Invite friends or family members to join you and your loved one.
Depending on where you live or your loved one’s mobility, you may not have access to a variety of places where LGBTQ+ people gather. Try to take advantage of virtual communities. Almost every hobby has a subset of LGBTQ+ enthusiasts online with whom you can connect and chat about shared interests. A great place to start is the Family Caregiver Alliance’s LGBTQ+ Community Support: Caregiving for our Families and Friends online support group.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/special-concerns-lgbt-caregivers/,Special Concerns of LGBTQ+ Caregivers,"Most issues that you will face as an LGBTQ+ caregiver for an aging parent or relative are the same as those faced by all caregivers. In a family of origin, it is typical for one child to assume the role of primary caregiver for an aging parent or parents. That responsibility often falls to the person who lives closest to the parents or who does not have young children. For LGBTQ+ people, the assumption that they do not have family responsibilities of their own if they do not have children can be particularly hurtful.
Even if you are “out” to siblings and relatives, they may not understand or appreciate that being part of a chosen family means you have serious obligations and commitments. Depending on family dynamics and communication styles, your role as a primary caregiver may be assumed without discussion.

If you need help setting clear boundaries with your siblings and relatives, one option is to ask a local caregiver-support agency or social worker for assistance in facilitating a family meeting. All members of the family—especially the primary caregiver—should think about what needs to be discussed. The person providing most of the care should explain what part of the responsibility he or she feels able to shoulder and what help is needed. It is appropriate and important to set limits and not to agree to more than you can handle just to preserve family harmony. (See FCA’s fact sheet Holding a Family Meeting.)",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/special-concerns-lgbt-caregivers/,Special Concerns of LGBTQ+ Caregivers,"Providing care for a loved one can span weeks, months, or in many cases, years. Learning to ask for support and taking care of your own emotional, physical and spiritual health are important considerations for every caregiver. LGBTQ+ caregivers may also need to consider some additional factors when strategizing ways to find support and assistance.
To live openly and honestly, many LGBTQ+ people have had to make the difficult decision to live without contact or support from their family of origin. Many LGBTQ+ adults have also chosen not to have children of their own. In these cases, extended family may not be a source of assistance and support. If this is true for you, it is especially important to reach out to chosen family members for help, as well as turning to community, medical, and assisted-living support services when necessary.
There are various state and federal programs designed to support caregivers. The National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) distributes money to states, which in turn fund local Area Agencies on Aging to provide services directly or to contract with community agencies to offer support. The language authorizing the program is broad and inclusive, defining a family caregiver as “an adult family member, or another individual, who is an informal provider of in-home and community care to an older individual.” The types of services funded by the NFCSP include counseling, legal advice, and access to a respite or break from caregiving.
Familiarity with LGBTQ+-specific issues will vary widely in these agencies. If you meet resistance from one person, ask to speak to someone who has training or experience working with LGBTQ+ seniors and caregivers. To learn more about NFCSP services, contact the Office on Aging or the Area Agency on Aging that serves the region in which the person you care for resides.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/stroke/,Stroke,"Ischemic stroke: Caused by a blockage in an artery, is responsible for about 85% of all strokes. Despite extensive evaluation, many strokes of this type are of unknown etiology. Fortunately, preventative treatments are effective for all types of ischemic stroke. The most common ischemic stroke subtypes are:
Thrombotic stroke: A blood clot (thrombus) forms in an artery in the neck or brain. These arteries may have a build-up of fatty deposits called plaques.
Embolic stroke: A blockage caused by blood clots that form elsewhere in the body (usually the heart) and travel to the brain. A common source is an abnormal rhythm in the heart’s two upper chambers (atrial fibrillation), which may cause clots to form.
Hemorrhagic stroke: Hemorrhage means bleeding. This type of stroke is caused by a leak or rupture of an artery in the brain or on its surface. Such ruptures can be caused by an aneurysm (a thin, weak area on an artery wall) or by a malformation of the brain’s blood vessel system. Hemorrhages may occur within the brain itself, or in the space between the brain and its protective outer layer. Approximately 15% of all strokes are caused by hemorrhage.
Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs): Often called mini-strokes, TIAs are actually short episodes of stroke symptoms, often lasting only a few minutes. TIAs are caused by a temporary decrease in the supply of blood to part of the brain, and do not leave obvious lasting effects.

However, there are many other conditions which may mimic stroke, and it is essential to have a medical professional determine the cause of these symptoms. It’s important to learn to recognize these symptoms, and if possible, to note when they began. Although they may not cause pain and may even disappear quickly, they are clear warning signs that a stroke has occurred or may soon follow. Every minute counts: the sooner you get treatment (ideally within 60 minutes), the greater the chance that permanent damage will be reduced. If you experience any stroke warning signs, contact your doctor or healthcare provider, go to the emergency room, or call 911 immediately!",stroke
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/stroke/,Stroke,"Correctly determining the underlying cause and location of the stroke will determine the treatment. Improved medical technology has greatly increased the ability to accurately diagnose strokes and assess the damage to the brain. However, it is not always easy to recognize small strokes because symptoms may be dismissed by the patient and family as changes due to aging, or may be confused with symptoms of other neurological illnesses. As noted earlier, any episode of stroke warning signs requires immediate medical evaluation. As healthcare professionals will tell you, “time lost is brain lost.”",stroke
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/stroke/,Stroke,"Several risk factors make a person more likely to experience a stroke. These risks include controllable factors (those you can change) and uncontrollable (those you cannot change). The good news is that more than half of all strokes can be prevented through medical attention and lifestyle changes.
Hypertension (high blood pressure): Stroke risk begins to increase when blood pressure is consistently higher than 115/75. High blood pressure, which is the leading cause of stroke, damages artery walls and can increase blood clotting action, leading to the formation of stroke-causing clots. While high blood pressure can increase stroke risk two to six times, controlling blood pressure reduces the risk substantially. A number of medications are available to help control high blood pressure.
Smoking: Smoking can double your stroke risk. In addition to harming the lungs, smoking also injures blood vessel walls, speeds up hardening of the arteries, makes your heart work harder, and raises blood pressure. Exposure to second-hand smoke also increases the risk of stroke. The good news is that if you stop smoking today, within two to five years your stroke risk will be the same as that of someone who never smoked.
High cholesterol and excess weight: A cholesterol level of 200 or lower is best for adults. Excess cholesterol can settle on artery walls and lead to the eventual blockage of these vessels. Being overweight strains the entire circulatory system and predisposes you to other stroke risk factors, such as high blood pressure. A sedentary lifestyle adds to the risk. Taking cholesterol-lowering statin drugs can decrease the risk of stroke.
You may not be able to change the following factors, but you can greatly minimize their impact on your overall stroke risk by concentrating efforts on the controllable factors listed above.
Age: Although young people can have strokes, the risk doubles with each decade past age 55.
Gender: Men have a slightly higher stroke risk than women.
Race: African-Americans have nearly double the risk of stroke as Caucasians.
Family history: A family history of stroke can mean you are at higher risk.
Diabetes: Circulation problems associated with the disease may increase stroke risk even if blood sugar and insulin levels are closely managed.
Cardiovascular disease: Having a heart attack can increase your stroke risk. An additional risk factor is a heart irregularity called atrial fibrillation (AF), a particular type of abnormal heartbeat affecting more than one million Americans. Normally, all four chambers of your heart beat in the same rhythm, somewhere between 60 and 100 times a minute. In someone with AF, the left atrium may beat rapidly and uncontrollably as many as 400 times a minute. If left untreated, AF can increase your stroke risk four- to six-fold. Medications can help treat this condition.
Recurrent stroke: A personal history of stroke increases your risk of having another stroke. The increased risk lasts approximately five years and declines over time; the greatest risk is in the first few months. In addition to addressing controllable stroke risk factors, stroke survivors may benefit from prescription medication to reduce their stroke risk.
TIAs: Having a transient ischemic attack (TIA) increases your risk of having a major stroke within the month, often within two days. Medications, including aspirin, may be prescribed to help prevent a future stroke.
In addition to the risk factors above, stroke has also been associated with heavy alcohol use (especially binge drinking); use of illegal drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamines; elevated red blood cell counts; migraine headaches with aura (visual disturbances); birth control pills, and hormone replacement therapy with estrogen. No direct relationship has yet been demonstrated between stress and stroke risk. As with many conditions, exercising for as little as 30 minutes most days of the week reduces your stroke risk.",stroke
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/stroke/,Stroke,"One reason for the urgency in evaluating stroke warning signs is that researchers have discovered that stroke-related brain damage can extend beyond the area directly involved in the stroke, and can worsen over the first 24 hours. Medical staff seek to limit or prevent this secondary damage by administering, if appropriate, specific medications within the first few hours post-stroke.
When a stroke occurs, hospitalization is necessary to determine the cause and type of stroke and to treat or prevent further complications. Treatment with surgery as well as medications may be needed.
Once the stroke survivor’s condition is stabilized and neurological deficits no longer appear to be progressing, rehabilitation begins. Rehabilitation does not cure a stroke. Instead, it focuses on minimizing permanent damage and enhancing adaptation. Rehabilitation may include intensive retraining in a variety of areas including movement, balance, perception of space and body, bowel/bladder control, language, and new methods of psychological and emotional adaptation. Stroke rehabilitation programs consist of the coordinated efforts of many health professionals.
Approximately 80% of all stroke survivors have physical, perceptual, and language deficits that can be helped through rehabilitation. Sometimes people do not receive the services they need because they are not referred to them or because insurers state that they do not cover the cost. You may need to ask a lot of questions and be assertive to get the help you need. A hospital discharge planner should assist with referrals to rehabilitation centers. A social worker can also be useful in making special arrangements for long-term care and referrals to community resources.",stroke
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/stroke/,Stroke,"Recovery from a stroke is variable: some people may have a full recovery while others will have slight, moderate, or severe disabilities. The most rapid recovery occurs during the first 30 days after the stroke. The particular after-effects experienced by a stroke survivor will depend upon the location and extent of the stroke and how quickly he or she received treatment. Strokes that occur in the left hemisphere (half) of the brain can affect communication and memory, as well as movement on the right side of the body. Strokes that occur in the right hemisphere of the brain can affect spatial and perceptual abilities, as well as movement on the left side of the body.
Although no two stroke survivors will experience exactly the same injuries or disabilities, physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms common to many stroke survivors include:
Paralysis or weakness: Usually on one side of the body, including the face and mouth. Patients may have difficulty swallowing or experience one-sided neglect (ignoring or forgetting the affected side of the body).
Vision problems: The patient may be unable to focus, may have a blind spot, or may have problems with peripheral vision.
Communication difficulties: Aphasia is a term used to describe a collection of communication deficits, including problems with speaking, understanding, reading, and writing.
Emotional lability: Uncontrollable, unexplained outward displays of crying, anger, or laughter which may have little connection to the patient’s actual emotional state. Episodes generally come and go quickly and may decrease over time.
Depression: Anxiety (especially over the possibility of having another stroke) and depression are not uncommon after a stroke, and may have both physiological and psychological causes. Medications may be recommended to help alleviate these symptoms.",stroke
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/stroke/,Stroke,"Caring for someone with a stroke is challenging. Behavior, memory, communication, and physical capabilities can all be impacted by stroke. When a loved one is first hospitalized immediately after a stroke, families usually step in to help supply information about the patient’s history and symptoms, check on treatments, convey patient care preferences, and generally serve as the connection between the hospital staff and the patient. You suddenly become the patient’s voice and chief advocate.
As treatment progresses, you, as primary caregiver, also might be involved in choosing a rehabilitation (rehab) facility, coordinating home care services, providing transportation, housekeeping, and cooking, and communicating with physicians and rehab staff. As time goes on and continuing deficits persist, you also may be dealing with the patient’s depression, physical care needs, coordinating home care and occupational, speech, or physical therapy, facilitating communication if there is speech impairment, and providing mental and social stimulation.
It’s helpful to remember that you’re not alone in this task—help is available in the community and it’s important to seek it out. Rehab can be a long process with slow and sometimes erratic progress—every person’s recovery journey is different. Your role as advocate will continue. During recovery, try to focus on the patient’s capabilities rather than limitations, and to show encouragement for every new gain, small or large.
Although providing care for a loved one may feel all-consuming, try to be aware of your own health and the ways any resulting stress may be affecting you. To help avoid caregiver burnout, try to get enough sleep, eat healthily, attend to your own medical needs, and get exercise when you can.
Counseling and respite help (meaning a break in caregiving provided by a family member, friend, or hired care provider) can allow you some alone time to regroup and renew your energy for the tasks ahead. Be sure to ask for help when you feel the need. Getting support for yourself, as well as your loved one, is necessary and beneficial for both the person you are caring for and you.",stroke

What do you do? As we all know, the first rule is to put on your own oxygen mask before you assist anyone else. Only when we first help ourselves can we effectively help others. Caring for yourself is one of the most important—and one of the most often forgotten—things you can do as a caregiver. When your needs are taken care of, the person you care for will benefit, too.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/taking-care-you-self-care-family-caregivers/,Taking Care of YOU: Self-Care for Family Caregivers,"We hear this often: “My husband is the person with Alzheimer’s, but now I’m the one in the hospital!” Such a situation is all too common. Researchers know a lot about the effects of caregiving on health and well-being. For example, if you are a caregiving spouse between the ages of 66 and 96 and are experiencing mental or emotional strain, you have a risk of dying that is 63 percent higher than that of people your age who are not caregivers.1 The combination of loss, prolonged stress, the physical demands of caregiving, and the biological vulnerabilities that come with age place you at risk for significant health problems as well as an earlier death.
Older caregivers are not the only ones who put their health and well-being at risk. If you are a baby boomer who has assumed a caregiver role for your parents while simultaneously juggling work and raising adolescent children, you face an increased risk for depression, chronic illness, and a possible decline in quality of life.
But despite these risks, family caregivers of any age are less likely than non-caregivers to practice preventive healthcare and self-care behavior. Regardless of age, sex, and race and ethnicity, caregivers report problems attending to their own health and well-being while managing caregiving responsibilities. They report:
Sleep deprivation
Poor eating habits
Failure to exercise
Failure to stay in bed when ill
Postponement of or failure to make medical appointments for themselves
Family caregivers are also at increased risk for depression and excessive use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. Caregiving can be an emotional roller coaster. On the one hand, caring for your family member demonstrates love and commitment and can be a very rewarding personal experience. On the other hand, exhaustion, worry, inadequate resources, and continuous care demands are enormously stressful. Caregivers are more likely to have a chronic illness than are non-caregivers, namely high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and a tendency to be overweight. Studies show that an estimated 46 percent to 59 percent of caregivers are clinically depressed.",[]

But there is a great deal that you can do to take responsibility for your personal well-being and to get your own needs met.,[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/taking-care-you-self-care-family-caregivers/,Taking Care of YOU: Self-Care for Family Caregivers,"Many times, attitudes and beliefs form personal barriers that stand in the way of caring for yourself. Not taking care of yourself may be a lifelong pattern, with taking care of others an easier option. However, as a family caregiver you must ask yourself: “What good will I be to the person I care for if I become ill? If I die?” Breaking old patterns and overcoming obstacles is not an easy proposition, but it can be done—regardless of your age or situation. The first task in removing personal barriers to self-care is to identify what is in your way. For example:
Do you think you are being selfish if you put your needs first?
Is it frightening to think of your own needs? What is the fear about?
Do you have trouble asking for what you need? Do you feel inadequate if you ask for help?
Do you feel you have to prove that you are worthy of the care recipient’s affection? Do you do too much as a result?
Sometimes caregivers have misconceptions that increase their stress and get in the way of good self-care. Here are some of the most commonly expressed:
I am responsible for my parent’s health.
If I donʼt do it, no one will.
If I do it right, I will get the love, attention, and respect I deserve.
Our family always takes care of their own.
I promised my father I would always take care of my mother.
“I never do anything right,” or “Thereʼs no way I could find the time to exercise” are examples of negative self-talk, another possible barrier that can cause unnecessary anxiety. Instead, try positive statements: “Iʼm good at giving John a bath.” “I can exercise for 15 minutes a day.” Remember, your mind tends to believe what you tell it.
Because we base our behavior on our thoughts and beliefs, attitudes and misconceptions like those noted above can cause caregivers to continually attempt to do what cannot be done, to control what cannot be controlled. The result is feelings of continued failure and frustration and, often, an inclination to ignore your own needs. Ask yourself what might be getting in your way and keeping you from taking care of yourself.",[]

The stress you feel is not only the result of your caregiving situation but also the result of your perception of it—whether you see the glass as half-full or half-empty. It is important to remember that you are not alone in your experiences.
Your level of stress is influenced by many factors, including the following:
Whether your caregiving is voluntary. If you feel you had no choice in taking on the responsibilities, the chances are greater that you will experience strain, distress, and resentment.
Your relationship with the care recipient. Sometimes people care for another with the hope of healing a relationship. If healing does not occur, you may feel regret and discouragement.
Your coping abilities. How you coped with stress in the past predicts how you will cope now. Identify your current coping strengths so that you can build on them.
Your caregiving situation. Some caregiving situations are more stressful than others. For example, caring for a person with dementia is often more stressful than caring for someone with a physical limitation.

These might include irritability, sleep problems, and forgetfulness. Know your own warning signs, and act to make changes. Donʼt wait until you are overwhelmed.
Identify sources of stress. Ask yourself, “What is causing stress for me?” Sources of stress might be that you have too much to do, family disagreements, feelings of inadequacy, or the inability to say no.
Identify what you can and cannot change. Remember, we can only change ourselves; we cannot change another person. When you try to change things over which you have no control, you will only increase your sense of frustration. Ask yourself, “What do I have some control over? What can I change?” Even a small change can make a big difference. The challenge we face as caregivers is well expressed in the following words modified from the original Serenity Prayer (attributed to American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr):
“God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
and (the) wisdom to know the difference.”
Take action. Taking some action to reduce stress gives us back a sense of control. Stress reducers can be simple activities like walking and other forms of exercise, gardening, meditation, or having coffee with a friend. Identify some stress reducers that work for you.

Here are some sample goals you might set:
Take a break from caregiving.
Get help with caregiving tasks like bathing and preparing meals.
Engage in activities that will make you feel more healthy.
Goals are generally too big to work on all at once. We are more likely to reach a goal if we break it down into smaller action steps. Once you’ve set a goal, ask yourself, “What steps do I take to reach my goal?” Make an action plan by deciding which step you will take first, and when. Then get started!
Example (Goal and Action Steps):
Goal: Feel more healthy.
Possible action steps:
Make an appointment for a physical checkup.

The real problem might not be what first comes to mind. For example, you think that the problem is simply that you are tired all the time, when the more basic difficulty is your belief that “no one can care for John like I can.” The problem? Thinking that you have to do everything yourself.
List possible solutions. One idea is to try a different perspective: “Even though someone else provides help to John in a different way than I do, it can be just as good.” Ask a friend to help. Call Family Caregiver Alliance or the Eldercare Locator (see Resources list) and ask about agencies in your area that could help provide care.
Select one solution from the list. Then try it!
Evaluate the results. Ask yourself how well your choice worked.
Try a second solution. If your first idea didnʼt work, select another. But donʼt give up on the first; sometimes an idea just needs fine-tuning.
Use other resources. Ask friends, family members, and professionals for suggestions.
If nothing seems to help, accept that the problem may not be solvable now. You can revisit it at another time.

Respect the rights and feelings of others. Do not say something that will violate another personʼs rights or intentionally hurt the personʼs feelings. Recognize that the other person has the right to express feelings.
Be clear and specific. Speak directly to the person. Donʼt hint or hope the person will guess what you need. Other people are not mind readers. When you speak directly about what you need or feel, you are taking the risk that the other person might disagree or say no to your request, but that action also shows respect for the other personʼs opinion. When both parties speak directly, the chances of reaching understanding are greater.
Be a good listener. Listening is the most important aspect of communication.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/taking-care-you-self-care-family-caregivers/,Taking Care of YOU: Self-Care for Family Caregivers,"When people have asked if they can be of help to you, how often have you replied, “Thank you, but I’m fine.” Many caregivers donʼt know how to marshal the goodwill of others and are reluctant to ask for help. You may not wish to “burden” others or admit that you can’t handle everything yourself.
Be prepared with a mental list of ways that others could help you. For example, someone could take the person you care for on a 15-minute walk a couple of times a week. Your neighbor could pick up a few things for you at the grocery store. A relative could fill out some insurance papers. When you break down the jobs into very simple tasks, it is easier for people to help. And they do want to help. It is up to you to tell them how.
Help can come from community resources, family, friends, and professionals. Ask them. Donʼt wait until you are overwhelmed and exhausted or your health fails. Reaching out for help when you need it is a sign of personal strength.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/taking-care-you-self-care-family-caregivers/,Taking Care of YOU: Self-Care for Family Caregivers,"Consider the personʼs special abilities and interests. If you know a friend enjoys cooking but dislikes driving, your chances of getting help improve if you ask for help with meal preparation.
Resist asking the same person repeatedly. Do you keep asking the same person because she has trouble saying no?
Pick the best time to make a request. Timing is important. A person who is tired and stressed might not be available to help out. Wait for a better time.
Prepare a list of things that need doing. The list might include errands, yard work, or a visit with your loved one. Let the “helper” choose what she would like to do.
Be prepared for hesitance or refusal. It can be upsetting for the caregiver when a person is unable or unwilling to help. But in the long run, it would do more harm to the relationship if the person helps only because he doesnʼt want to upset you. To the person who seems hesitant, simply say, “Why donʼt you think about it.” Try not to take it personally when a request is turned down. The person is turning down the task, not you. Try not to let a refusal prevent you from asking for help again. The person who refused today may be happy to help at another time.
Avoid weakening your request. “Itʼs only a thought, but would you consider staying with Grandma while I went to church?” This request sounds like itʼs not very important to you. Use “I” statements to make specific requests: “I would like to go to church on Sunday. Would you stay with Grandma from 9 a.m. until noon?”

Some 77 percent of those caregivers report the need to ask for advice about the medications and medical treatments. The person they usually turn to is their physician.
But while caregivers will discuss their loved oneʼs care with the physician, caregivers seldom talk about their own health, which is equally important. Building a partnership with a physician that addresses the health needs of the care recipient and the caregiver is crucial. The responsibility of this partnership ideally is shared between you, the caregiver, the physician, and other healthcare staff.

Make a list of your most important concerns and problems. Issues you might want to discuss with the physician are changes in symptoms, medications or general health of the care recipient, your own comfort in your caregiving situation, or specific help you need to provide care. The physician only sees a moment in time with the patient. Make sure you let him/her know what your concerns are in terms of daily care/health.
Enlist the help of the nurse. Many caregiving questions relate more to nursing than to medicine. In particular, the nurse can answer questions about various tests and examinations, preparing for surgical procedures, providing personal care, and managing medications at home.
Make sure your appointment meets your needs. For example, the first appointment in the morning or after lunch are the best times to reduce your waiting time or accommodate numerous questions. When you schedule your appointment, be sure you convey clearly the reasons for your visit so that enough time is allowed.
Call ahead. Before the appointment, check to see if the doctor is on schedule. Remind the receptionist of special needs when you arrive at the office.
Take someone with you. A companion can ask questions you feel uncomfortable asking and can help you remember what the physician and nurse said.
Use assertive communication and “I” messages. Enlist the medical care team as partners in care. Present what you need, what your concerns are, and how the doctor and/or nurse can help. Use specific, clear “I” statements like the following: “I need to know more about the diagnosis; I will feel better prepared for the future if I know what’s in store for me.” Or “I am feeling rundown. I’d like to make an appointment for myself and my husband next week.” Or “I need a way for my mother to sleep at night as I am now exhausted being up every two hours at night with her.” ",[]

Perhaps you think that physical exercise might harm you, or that it is only for people who are young and able to do things like jogging. Fortunately, research suggests that you can maintain or at least partly restore endurance, balance, strength, and flexibility through everyday physical activities like walking and gardening. Even household chores can improve your health. The key is to increase your physical activity by exercising and using your own muscle power.
Exercise promotes better sleep, reduces tension and depression, and increases energy and alertness. If finding time for exercise is a problem, incorporate it into your daily activity. Perhaps the care recipient can walk or do stretching exercise with you. If necessary, do frequent short exercises instead of those that require large blocks of time. Find activities you enjoy.
Walking, one of the best and easiest exercises, is a great way to get started. Besides its physical benefits, walking helps to reduce psychological tension. Walking 20 minutes a day, three times a week, is very beneficial. If you canʼt get away for that long, try to walk for as long as you can on however many days you can. Work walking into your life. Walk around the mall, to the store, or a nearby park. Walk around the block with a friend.

Our emotions are messages to which we need to listen. They exist for a reason. However negative or painful, our feelings are useful tools for understanding what is happening to us. Even feelings such as guilt, anger, and resentment contain important messages. Learn from them, then take appropriate action.
For example, when you cannot enjoy activities you previously enjoyed, and your emotional pain overshadows all pleasure, it is time to seek treatment for depression—especially if you are having thoughts of suicide. Speaking with your physician is the first step. (See the FCA fact sheet Depression and Caregiving.)
Caregiving often involves a range of emotions. Some feelings are more comfortable than others. When you find that your emotions are intense, they might mean the following:
That you need to make a change in your caregiving situation.
That you are grieving a loss.
That you are experiencing increased stress.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/talking-your-parents-about-disability/,Talking with Your Parents About Disability,"A caregiver called our office recently to say his mother was being discharged from the hospital, was no longer able to live alone, and that he needed to hire an attendant. Stressed out and confused, he didn’t know what to do. We asked him what his finances were, so we could give him an appropriate referral. He said he didn’t know—he had never talked with his mother about money.
For many of us, the response would have been similar. Often, the conversations we need to have with our parents about long-term planning don’t happen until there is a crisis. Then we have to try and catch up, stressed by the many details that need to be addressed under very trying circumstances. Carefully considered decisions—an essential part of caregiving—are hard to come by.
It’s often difficult to know when and how to have a conversation about long-term care planning. As adult children, we may be reluctant to bring up the subject so as not to offend our parents or to imply that they are becoming sick or frail. Parents may fear that we are planning on moving them into a facility, as opposed to trying to help them maintain their independence.  It may seem that no time is the “right” time” to bring up this topic.
Sometimes, it’s easier to start the conversation by sharing your own experience or a story from the newspaper. For example, you might say, “I decided I needed a Will and consulted an attorney,” or “I saw an article in the paper about senior services.”
When talking about present and future needs, it is important to plan with your parents, not for them. Setting a date and time to have a conversation and including as many family members as possible will increase the likelihood of success. One way to start would be to ask your parents to talk about their perceptions of their needs, now and in the future. An agenda might include:
Health care wishes
Financial information
Wills and trusts
Names/addresses of close family friends
Doctor’s and dentist’s names and phone numbers
Insurance policy information
Additionally, you might discuss any changes their home might need to accommodate a disability. Increased lighting, grab bars for the bathroom, or people to help with cleaning, cooking, gardening, or transportation are all possibilities.
It might be uncomfortable to have these conversations. We might find ourselves resistant to bringing up these subjects, and we might be met with anger or resentment from our parents when we do. If this happens, remember, you don’t have to discuss everything all at once. Start small and with things that might not be so emotionally loaded. Continue to talk about these things when you get together the next time. The more you plan ahead for yourself, the more you can encourage your parents to do the same. Do you have a Will?  Advanced Health Care Directive?
Let your parents know you are concerned and care about them. But as long as your parents do not have dementia, they have a right to “bad” decisions or “bad” planning. This might make your role harder, but you cannot bully them into doing things they are not ready or willing to do.
If you think your parent does have dementia, then you’ll need to proceed in a different way. To start, it helps to work with your parent’s physician to get a diagnosis regarding memory problems your parent is having. Second, you need to assess whether your parent is feeling threatened and if this is due to his or her dementia. If so, bringing up these subjects might make him or her even more scared and more resistant to talking. Ask help from a trusted friend, attorney, or pastor to calm and reassure your parent. Our tendency might be to want to take over and to start to organize things. This will generally make matters worse. Ask your parent to help you by doing certain things. For some, saying, “I know sometimes you forget things. I would like to help make it easier for you,” will allow your parent to feel respected in giving up some tasks he or she used to do. For others, mentioning memory loss at all could lead to defensiveness. In that case, approaching your parent with, “I’d like to help you. Can you tell me what I can do to assist you?” could lead to a further conversation about long-term planning and letting you help your parent. If your parent says everything is fine, you then you might try to point out one little thing that you noticed might need doing, for example ironing the clothes or pruning the roses. That will help your parent feel less threatened about your “taking over” his or her life.
Our family consultants can help you navigate the communication that can lead to good care planning with your parents. Feel free to call FCA at (800) 445-8106, or email info@caregiver.org.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/ten-real-life-strategies-dementia-caregiving/,Ten Real-Life Strategies for Dementia Caregiving,"As caregivers, we often use intuition to help us decide what to do. No one ever gave us lessons on how to relate to someone with memory loss. Unfortunately, dealing with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias is counterintuitive; i.e., often the right thing to do is exactly opposite that which seems like the right thing to do. Here is some practical advice:
Being Reasonable, Rational, and Logical Will Just Get You into Trouble.
When someone is acting in ways that don’t make sense, we tend to carefully explain the situation, calling on his or her sense of appropriateness to get compliance. However, the person with dementia doesn’t have a “boss” in his brain any longer, so he does not respond to our arguments, no matter how logical. Straightforward, simple sentences about what is going to happen are usually the best.
People with Dementia Do Not Need to Be Grounded in Reality.
When someone has memory loss, he often forgets important things, e.g., that his mother is deceased. When we remind him of this loss, we remind him about the pain of that loss also. When someone wants to go home, reassuring him that he is at home often leads to an argument. Redirecting and asking someone to tell you about the person he has asked about or about his home is a better way to calm a person with dementia.
You Cannot Be a Perfect Caregiver.
Just as there is no such thing as a perfect parent, there is no such thing as a perfect caregiver. You have the right to the full range of human emotions, and sometimes you are going to be impatient or frustrated. Learning to forgive your loved one as well as yourself is essential in the caregiving journey.
Therapeutic Lying Reduces Stress.
We tend to be meticulously honest with people. However, when someone has dementia, honesty can lead to distress both for us and the one we are caring for. Does it really matter that your loved one thinks she is the volunteer at the day care center? Is it okay to tell your loved one that the two of you are going out to lunch and then “coincidentally” stop by the doctor’s office on the way home to pick something up as a way to get her to the doctor?
Making Agreements Doesn’t Work.
If you ask your loved one to not do something ever again, or to remember to do something, it will soon be forgotten. For people in early stage dementia, leaving notes as reminders can sometimes help, but as the disease progresses, this will not work. Taking action, rearranging the environment, rather than talking and discussing, is usually a more successful approach. For example, getting a tea kettle with an automatic “off” switch is better than warning someone of the dangers of leaving the stove on.
Doctors Often Need to Be Educated By You.
Telling the doctor what you see at home is important. The doctor can’t tell during an examination that your loved one has been up all night pacing. Sometimes doctors, too, need to deal with therapeutic lying; e.g., telling the patient that an antidepressant is for memory rather than depression.
You Can’t Do It All. It’s OK to Accept Help Before You Get Desperate.
When people offer to help, the answer should always be “YES.” Have a list of things people can do to help you, whether it is bringing a meal, picking up a prescription, helping trim the roses, or staying with your loved one while you run an errand. This will reinforce offers of help. It is harder to ask for help than to accept it when it is offered, so don’t wait until you “really need it” to get support.
It Is Easy to Both Overestimate and Underestimate What Your Loved One Can Do.
It is often easier to do something for our loved ones than to let them do it for themselves. However, if we do it for them, they will lose the ability to be independent in that skill. On the other hand, if we insist individuals do something for themselves and they get frustrated, we just make our loved one’s agitated and probably haven’t increased their abilities to perform tasks. Not only is it a constant juggle to find the balance, but be aware that the balance may shift from day to day.
Tell, Don’t Ask.
Asking “What would you like for dinner?” may have been a perfectly normal question at another time. But now we are asking our loved one to come up with an answer when he or she might not have the words for what they want, might not be hungry, and even if they answer, might not want the food when it is served after all. Saying “We are going to eat now” encourages the person to eat and doesn’t put them in the dilemma of having failed to respond.
It Is Perfectly Normal to Question the Diagnosis When Someone Has Moments of Lucidity.
One of the hardest things to do is to remember that we are responding to a disease, not the person who once was. Everyone with dementia has times when they make perfect sense and can respond appropriately. We often feel like that person has been faking it or that we have been exaggerating the problem when these moments occur. We are not imagining things—they are just having one of those moments, to be treasured when they occur.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/ten-tips-for-communicating-with-a-person-with-dementia/,Ten Tips for Communicating with a Person with Dementia,"We aren’t born knowing how to communicate with a person with dementia—but we can learn. Improving your communication skills will help make caregiving less stressful and will likely improve the quality of your relationship with your loved one. Good communication skills will also enhance your ability to handle the difficult behavior you may encounter as you care for a person with a dementing illness.
Set a positive mood for interaction. Your attitude and body language communicate your feelings and thoughts more strongly than your words do. Set a positive mood by speaking to your loved one in a pleasant and respectful manner. Use facial expressions, tone of voice, and physical touch to help convey your message and show your feelings of affection.
Get the person’s attention. Limit distractions and noise—turn off the radio or TV, close the curtains or shut the door, or move to quieter surroundings. Before speaking, make sure you have her attention; address her by name, identify yourself by name and relation, and use nonverbal cues and touch to help keep her focused. If she is seated, get down to her level and maintain eye contact.
State your message clearly. Use simple words and sentences. Speak slowly, distinctly, and in a reassuring tone. Refrain from raising your voice higher or louder; instead, pitch your voice lower. If she doesn’t understand the first time, use the same wording to repeat your message or question. If she still doesn’t understand, wait a few minutes and rephrase the question. Use the names of people and places instead of pronouns (he, she, they) or abbreviations.
Ask simple, answerable questions. Ask one question at a time; those with yes or no answers work best. Refrain from asking open-ended questions or giving too many choices. For example, ask, “Would you like to wear your white shirt or your blue shirt?” Better still, show her the choices—visual prompts and cues also help clarify your question and can guide her response.
Listen with your ears, eyes, and heart. Be patient in waiting for your loved one’s reply. If she is struggling for an answer, it’s okay to suggest words. Watch for nonverbal cues and body language, and respond appropriately. Always strive to listen for the meaning and feelings that underlie the words.
Break down activities into a series of steps. This makes many tasks much more manageable. You can encourage your loved one to do what he can, gently remind him of steps he tends to forget, and assist with steps he’s no longer able to accomplish on his own. Using visual cues, such as showing him with your hand where to place the dinner plate, can be very helpful.
When the going gets tough, distract and redirect. If your loved one becomes upset or agitated, try changing the subject or the environment. For example, ask him for help or suggest going for a walk. It is important to connect with the person on a feeling level, before you redirect. You might say, “I see you’re feeling sad—I’m sorry you’re upset. Let’s go get something to eat.”
Respond with affection and reassurance. People with dementia often feel confused, anxious, and unsure of themselves. Further, they often get reality confused and may recall things that never really occurred. Avoid trying to convince them they are wrong. Stay focused on the feelings they are demonstrating (which are real) and respond with verbal and physical expressions of comfort, support, and reassurance. Sometimes holding hands, touching, hugging, and praise will get the person to respond when all else fails.
Remember the good old days. Remembering the past is often a soothing and affirming activity. Many people with dementia may not remember what happened 45 minutes ago, but they can clearly recall their lives 45 years earlier. Therefore, avoid asking questions that rely on short-term memory, such as asking the person what they had for lunch. Instead, try asking general questions about the person’s distant past—this information is more likely to be retained.
Maintain your sense of humor. Use humor whenever possible, though not at the person’s expense. People with dementia tend to retain their social skills and are usually delighted to laugh along with you.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/the-30-minute-strategy/,The 30-Minute Strategy,"“What makes the biggest difference to your health? What has the biggest return on investment?” These questions are posed by Dr. Mike Evans in a popular YouTube video he created, “23 and 1/2 hours: What is the single best thing we can do for our health?” that over 2.4 million people have already watched. In an engaging narrative, Dr. Evans quickly covers a number of studies and explains that research has found that this intervention has been found effective at addressing a wide variety of health issues, including knee arthritis, diabetes (coupled with other lifestyle changes), the risk of hip fractures, depression, anxiety, mortality, and overall quality of life. What is the intervention? We’ll give you a hint—this intervention is so popular that the cast of the West Wing reunited to discuss it recently in a mini-sketch “Walk and Talk: The West Wing Reunion” that highlights the intervention while also poking fun at the show’s trademark “walk and talk” routine. The answer? It turns out that simply walking 30 minutes a day can pay enormous dividends in your health and quality of life. So, how is this relevant to family caregivers? Enter the Go4Life Campaign®, sponsored by the National Institute on Aging. Through this campaign (Family Caregiver Alliance is a “Team Member”), the National Institute on Aging is reaching out to older adults to help them become physically active, whether it’s for the first time, returning to exercise after a break, or simply building more physical activity into a daily routine. The Go4Life Campaign website features a number of excellent resources in English and Spanish that can be downloaded or ordered (for free) for individuals or organizations. And, the exercise examples are intended for people aged 50 or older to do in a variety of settings. The resources include:
An exercise and physical activity guide
A “Workout to Go” guide with 13 easy-to-follow exercises
Posters and bookmarks for organizations to use with their members, employees, community, or customers

In addition to the numerous studies on the health risks of being a caregiver, staff at FCA also know from speaking directly with caregivers that their own health is often placed on the back burner. Exercise is not only good for your health (see the many ways here), but can also be a mini-break from caregiving. When you’re out on a walk, jog, or even a run, your mind can wander a little bit away from the tasks waiting for you at home. As the Mayo Clinic points out, physical activity tells your brain to increase the production of endorphins, which they call “your brain’s feel-good neurotransmitters,” and which is also referred to as the runner’s high. One of the hardest parts about exercising is getting started. So, pick an easy target to begin with, for example, “I’ll walk for 30 minutes at least once this week.” As you become more comfortable with the routine, you can increase it. We’re including a few resources below that can be helpful to get started.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/emotional-side-caregiving/,The Emotional Side of Caregiving,"Whether you become a caregiver gradually or all of sudden due to a crisis, or whether you are a caregiver willingly or by default, many emotions surface when you take on the job of caregiving. Some of these feelings happen right away and some don’t surface until you have been caregiving for awhile. Whatever your situation, it is important to remember that you, too, are important. All of your emotions, good and bad, about caregiving are not only allowed, but valid and important.
Many feelings come up when you are caring for someone day in and day out. Many caregivers set out saying, “This won’t happen to me. I love my mother, father, husband, wife, sister, brother, friend, etc.” But after awhile, the “negative” emotions that we tend to want to bury or pretend we aren’t feeling come up. Caregivers are often reluctant to express these negative feelings for fear they will be judged by others (or judge themselves) or don’t want to burden others with their problems.
If you don’t deal with ALL of your emotions, they can be like a two-year-old who wants your attention: they will keep tugging at you until you stop and acknowledge them. Not paying attention to your feelings can lead to poor sleep, illness, trouble coping, stress eating, substance abuse, etc.  When you admit to your feelings, you can then find productive ways to express them and deal with them, so that you and the care receiver can cope better in the future.
This fact sheet will identify some of the common, often hard to admit, feelings that caregivers experience. Once identified, suggestions for how you might better cope with these feelings are offered.",[]

Anger and frustration are a normal part of being around someone who needs help on an ongoing basis and who might not be accepting of help. Caring for someone with dementia, in particular, can be even harder, as the care receiver can be irrational and combative. It’s not always possible to be in perfect control of your emotions. Anger “just comes out” sometimes.
Coping:  Forgive yourself. Find constructive ways to express yourself, learn to walk away and give yourself a “time out.” Identify supportive people you can talk to who will listen as you vent about the things that happened that day.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/emotional-side-caregiving/,The Emotional Side of Caregiving,"Feeling like things are out of control and not knowing how to bring them back into control often produces feelings of anxiousness.

Coping: Respite can help. Getting a break from caregiving and having some time for yourself will not only increase your patience and resilience but will give you a chance to do something that is meaningful to you, whether it is socializing, going for a walk, or reading a good book.                             ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/emotional-side-caregiving/,The Emotional Side of Caregiving,"When tired and stressed, it is harder to stay in control of the things we say and feel. Feelings can go up and down very rapidly. We can lash out at the littlest thing because we have no reserve.
Coping: If you find yourself feeling cranky and irritable, you probably need a break.You also may need to get some rest, as we are in less control when tired. Often we will turn to alcohol or our favorite junk food to reward ourselves when feeling this way. It’s more beneficial to keep a journal or talk with a friend or professional to let off steam.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/emotional-side-caregiving/,The Emotional Side of Caregiving,"As a caregiver, you are at risk for depression. Sometimes this is feeling hopeless or helpless, the inability to sleep, or trouble getting up and facing the day. And sometimes it makes you want to cry. (See FCA fact sheet Depression and Caregiving.)
Coping:  Depression is treatable and should be taken seriously. Professional help is available. Talk to your physician if you think you might be depressed, join a caregiver support group, find a counselor who understands caregiving, and ask for help from friends and family. Exercise. Moving your body is a proven way to relieve some of the symptoms of depression.          ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/emotional-side-caregiving/,The Emotional Side of Caregiving,"Having to help toilet someone can be too intimate an experience for many caregivers. If the care receiver is incontinent of stool as well as urine, then changing an adult diaper can be nauseating and repulsive. Having to clean the private body parts of someone, like a parent, can be unnerving and uncomfortable. Watching someone eat sloppily or not care for personal appearance, or having to clean up vomit can also cause feelings of disgust.
Coping:  The hardest thing about accepting our revulsion to these things is that the care receiver is not in control of these behaviors. But sometimes we think they are doing it on purpose just to get to us. Or we feel guilty because we think we should be accepting but we are not. Finding ways to minimize your need to do personal care tasks including incontinence care is vital to weathering your caregiver journey, which could stretch on for years. Hire an attendant to do routine care or have someone from the family do these things who might cope better. Also, learn tricks to make tasks easier (e.g. during meal times consider, using a spoon that is designed to be spill resistant.)
An occupational therapist can help you find this tool and other tools to make meal time easier and more enjoyable for both of you. It’s important to know that when it comes to incontinence, you are not alone. Incontinence is one of the main reasons given for placing someone in a facility. There are resources to aid you in dealing with bathroom problems, such as a webinar entitled Moving Beyond the Leakages: Practical Strategies to Manage Incontinence, and a segment from our Caregiver College Video Series on our Video Channel. (Both of these resources are in the Caregiver Education section on our website.)",[]

Does he or she need to use the restroom right away and make a scene as you try to find one? Does he or she refuse to bathe and now have body odor? It is easy for us to feel responsible for the behavior of someone else and feel like it is our fault when these things happen.
Coping: Some people create cards (similar to business cards) which read, “My loved one has dementia and can no longer control their behavior” that they hand out to those around them when they are having trouble, especially in restaurants. Some people just stop leaving the house because this is such a difficult problem to manage, it’s  easier to stay home. Others have friends, family members, or an attendant accompany them when they go out to offer assistance, when needed.",[]

Am I responsible for things that go wrong? Caregivers take on a huge amount of responsibility, not only for the day to day care of the care receiver, but also for all the other things that “might” happen while being a caregiver. Scaring ourselves about the “what ifs” can be paralyzing and keep us from enjoying the “what is.”
Coping: It is important to have contingency plans. So, it might make sense to have a back up caregiver in mind in case something should happen to you, or to think about how you would handle predictable medical emergencies based on what disabilities your care receiver has. When you get scared, it is often helpful to talk to someone who knows your situation and can give you perspective and calm your fears.    ",[]

Sometimes, as a caregiver, you feel that you can’t do anything right or that things just don’t go as planned no matter what you do or how hard you try. And if you are tired, you are more likely to get frustrated. Frustration may lead to stress eating, substance abuse, and a higher likelihood of losing your temper.
Coping:  Acknowledge how frustrating caregiving can be. Join a support group to learn the tricks other caregivers have learned to make coping easier. Get breaks from caregiving so you have time for YOU and a chance to refresh your energy. Exercise. Sleep.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/emotional-side-caregiving/,The Emotional Side of Caregiving,"Watching the care receiver decline, not being able to do things that used to be easy and natural is sad. We also grieve for the care receiver, the person who used to be and our relationship with that person. We often need to grieve the loss we are experiencing on a daily basis or it will come out as something else. 
Coping:  Sometimes creating a ritual can be helpful. One caregiver would write on a piece of paper the things her husband could no longer do, then go to the ocean and throw the pieces in the water as a way of letting go. We tend to want to avoid the sadness that comes with grief, but allowing ourselves to feel (it) promotes healing. (See FCA fact sheet Grief and Loss.)",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/emotional-side-caregiving/,The Emotional Side of Caregiving,"Guilt is the feeling we have when we do something wrong.  Guilt in caring for care receivers comes in many forms.  There is guilt over not having done enough to have prevented them from getting sick in the first place. There is guilt over feeling like you want this to end. Or guilt over having been impatient with your care receiver too much. There is guilt over not loving or even liking the care receiver at times. There is guilt over not doing enough for the care receiver or not doing a good enough job as a caregiver. And if the care receiver falls or something else happens, there is guilt about it being your fault that it happened. And sometimes caregivers feel guilty about thinking of their own needs and see themselves as selfish, especially if they should do something like go to a movie or out to lunch with a friend. 
Coping:  You need permission to forgive yourself. You can’t be perfect 24/7. It’s impossible to be in perfect control of how you feel at all times. We all carry around a lot of “shoulds,” such as “No one will do as good of a job as I do, so I have to be here all the time.” Or “If I leave and something happens, I will never forgive myself.” Consider changing guilt into regret, “I’m in a difficult situation and I have to make difficult decisions sometimes.” “I regret that I am human and get impatient sometimes.” “I am dong the best I can even though things go wrong from time to time and I regret that I am not perfect.”",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/emotional-side-caregiving/,The Emotional Side of Caregiving,"How difficult is it to get your care receiver up in the morning? How about up, dressed, given breakfast and to their doctor’s appointment all before 10 a.m.? And you have other things to accomplish that day. All this and the care receiver is acting unhelpful and moving slowly. Perhaps the care receiver refuses to use his walker even though he has fallen many times and the doctor and physical therapist have emphasized he always needs to use it. It is understandable that you would get impatient at times. 
Coping: Forgive yourself. When tired, frustrated, and trying to keep things under control, it’s natural to want to speed up and have compliance from the care receiver to keep them safe and healthy. So, first, slow  down. Leave a lot of time to accomplish tasks. Leave a LOT of time. Control the environment as much as you can, but know you can’t always prevent your father from taking off without his walker. Create a list of the things you are in control of and are not. Understand what you can and cannot control.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/emotional-side-caregiving/,The Emotional Side of Caregiving,"Do you sometimes feel jealous of your friends who are able to go out and do things that you can no longer do, because of your caregiving responsibilities? Are you jealous of your siblings who are not doing their share to help? Do you feel jealous of a friend whose parent died quickly and easily while you take care of a parent who has had dementia for many years? Are we jealous of someone who got a big inheritance since we are struggling to pay bills and to be a good caregiver? We often don’t admit to this feeling, because we have always been told not to be jealous.  But that doesn’t mean that we don’t, in fact, feel jealous from time to time, of those who have it easier or better than us.
Coping:  It’s okay to admit to being jealous. Because things are not fair, we often have flashes of resentment and envy at other people’s good fortune compared to our own. Jealousy is a problem when we wallow in it and prevent ourselves from enjoying the things we DO  have. Focus on what you do have, whatever that may be, and find a place in your heart for gratitude.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/emotional-side-caregiving/,The Emotional Side of Caregiving,"Most of us do not want to be dependent on someone else. Learning to accept help is hard. So, the care receiver is often pushing away our attempts to be helpful and caring. If someone has dementia, this problem is often much worse. And we get our feelings hurt because the care receiver does not thank us or even see how much we are giving up in order to care for them.
Coping: Sometimes we have to give ourselves our own pat on the back. Writing in a journal about the things you do each day might help  you to appreciate how much you give and how much you do. Having a support group or a group of friends/family to cheer you on is important, and both comforting and necessary to remain resilient through your caregiving journey.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/emotional-side-caregiving/,The Emotional Side of Caregiving,"The longer you are a caregiver, the more isolated you become. With no one to talk to day in and day out except the care receiver, it is easy to lose a sense of yourself. Friends stop calling since we are no longer available and we hesitate to call them because we know “they don’t want to hear about it any more” or “I have nothing to talk about because my life is all about caregiving.”
Coping:  Find ways to get out of the house and involved in something other than caregiving. Learn about resources from your local Area Agency on Aging about respite programs or day care programs that will allow you to get a much-needed and well-deserved break. No one can do this job alone. Look at your wider circle of support—faith community, neighbors, friends, distant relatives, etc. to see where you might get some nurturing for you.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/emotional-side-caregiving/,The Emotional Side of Caregiving,"Caregivers experience many losses, some of which have already been mentioned: loss of control, loss of independence, loss of income, loss of your best friend, loss of the future, loss of a sense of yourself. Loss leads to grief and depression.
Coping:  Identifying your losses can help you to cope with them. For each of us, the losses will be different. When you know what you are feeling, you will be able to look at the loss and think about what might work for you to help you deal with it. (See FCA fact sheet Caregiving and Ambiguous Loss.)",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/emotional-side-caregiving/,The Emotional Side of Caregiving,"When put in a situation not of our choosing, it’s not uncommon to feel negative and resentful. Perhaps you have siblings who are not helping provide care or maybe you are an only child, became the caregiver by default, and feel you have very little desire or support to offer care. Little things easily become big things when we feel unappreciated and unacknowledged. And feeling like you have to do it all, and do it all by yourself, is a guaranteed way to feel resentment.
Coping: Family situations and dynamics can be a real challenge. Having help from family may make your situation easier, but sometimes family tensions make it even harder to get help. (See FCA Fact Sheet Caregiving with Your Siblings.) The more help and support you accept, the easier it will be to let go of feeling burdened and resentful of those who are not doing their share. If family tensions are getting in the way, it could also help you to refer to the FCA fact sheet Holding a Family Meeting. If you can’t get help from the people you think should be offering it, then you need to broaden your circle of people to include those who can and will help. It is easy to forget about the good things that have happened or are happening when we only focus on the negative.                   ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/emotional-side-caregiving/,The Emotional Side of Caregiving,"As a caregiver, how often do you get the full eight hours of sleep they always say you need? Sleep is often postponed while you grab a few minutes of alone time after the care receiver goes to bed. Sleep is often disturbed because the care receiver gets up at night and needs help going to the bathroom or being re-directed back to bed. Sleep is often disturbed because you can’t fall asleep or stay asleep because you are worrying about all the stressors that come with being a caregiver.
Coping: Sleep has to be put on the priority list. Lack of sleep leads to obesity, illness, crankiness, impatience, inefficiency in accomplishing tasks, and a state of mental fogginess among other issues. If you are having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep not related to direct caregiving, talk to your physician. If you are having trouble sleeping due to caregiving problems, talk to the care receiver’s physician. There are ways to help both of you to get the rest you need. As a caregiver, you do amazing work caring for others in need. But as a caregiver, you also need to think about yourself. (See FCA fact sheet Taking Care of YOU: Self Care for Family Caregivers, and also the fact sheet Caregiver Health.) Just pushing through each day will eventually wear you out and cause you to burn out. Emotional issues can weigh you down and impact not only your ability to cope and provide care, but they can also harm your health and well-being. It is important to learn to ask for help and prioritize getting breaks from caregiving, so that you can be the caregiver you want to be.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/the-post-discharge-checklist-5-important-steps/,The Post Discharge Checklist: 5 Important Steps,"Two weeks ago, Andrew’s elderly father suffered a heart attack. After undergoing bypass surgery, he is being released to return home. While his father is eager to get out of the hospital and back to the comfort of home, Andrew is hesitant about the transition. There are new medications to take, new specialists to see, and his father requires more assistance with daily activities than he did prior to the heart attack. While he’s pleased that his father is well enough to go home, Andrew’s not quite sure how to handle caregiving after the hospital discharge.
Andrew’s situation is a common one for caregivers the world over. Life can change significantly after a hospitalization, and while care may seem coordinated and well-organized in the hospital, caregivers can be left with a lot of questions about what to do after returning home. The list of five steps below can be used as a guide to help caregivers and their loved ones feel prepared for the smoothest possible transition back home.
1. Make a Post-Discharge Care Plan 
Before even signing the forms to head out the door, caregivers can help ease the transition by asking hospital staff for help in developing a post-discharge care plan. This plan will typically lay out the required care, such as new dietary restrictions or medications, any special equipment needed, follow-up care including in-home care or therapies, any changes in the patient’s care needs and functioning, and what support the caregiver needs to provide the new level of care. While you probably won’t know how to lay out a care plan on your own, social workers, nurses, and physicians at the hospital can help get the plan together and direct you to resources that may be helpful in carrying out the post-discharge care for your loved one.
2. Reconcile Medications 
The number of individuals that leave the hospital with medication errors is startling—up to 40% of seniors* have been found to leave the hospital with incorrect dosages, or new prescriptions that interact with current medications. (See FCA’s fact sheet, Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers and its cited sources.) Certain medication interactions can be potentially life-threatening, making the need to “reconcile,” or compare and confirm medications, very important. To complete this step, work with a physician or nurse to compare a complete medication list from before the hospitalization with the new list at discharge. Look carefully at any medications that have been added or stopped, as well as confirming the dosages and schedules of the medications. In addition to the physician or nurse, the pharmacist can be a great resource in making sure there aren’t any harmful drug interactions.
3. Schedule Follow-Up Visits 
As a caregiver, it’s not always easy to convince those you care for that they need to go to the doctor, especially after a stay in the hospital. However, follow-up visits as part of post-discharge care are critical to monitor a patient’s progress, adjust care activities or medications, and reduce the risk of re-hospitalization. Be sure to schedule follow-up visits as recommended by your loved one’s primary care physician and hospital providers. If you know that your loved one may be less than thrilled to head back to a doctor, try asking physicians and nurses to help stress the importance of getting checked up to avoid landing back in the hospital. The outside perspective may help in encouraging follow-up care. The discharging physician may also approve a home health nurse, physical therapist, or home health aide for more support and monitoring when the patient goes home. Before discharge, you should know who is coming to the home, when, and whether you need to arrange the appointments or if they will be calling you.
4. Ask Questions 
As a family caregiver, you probably know the ins and outs of caring for your loved one better than anyone else, which is why you have every right to ask questions of care providers before and after leaving the hospital. Perhaps you’re uncomfortable with the idea of needing to transfer your father from the bed to a wheelchair, or are unsure of what signs to look for that may signal a relapse of their condition. Don’t hesitate to ask nurses, doctors, and others involved in discharge care about any hesitations or concerns that you may have. In fact, you may find that asking questions helps hospital staff link you to resources or training that can help with the post-discharge care process. If you feel your ability to provide care after discharge will be limited by work or family obligations, your own health, or finances, ask the hospital staff about options for more in-home help or out-of-home care if needed.
5. Seek Support 

Caring for a loved one after hospital discharge can be an overwhelming process. While senior hospitalizations can be a hurdle filled with challenges, there is help. Resources ranging from social workers to support groups and home care providers can help you feel properly informed and prepared to take on post-discharge care. It is likely that you will face some difficulties, so try keeping the name and phone number of a contact person with you for easy reference, and don’t hesitate to ask questions that will surely come up throughout your care providing experience. For more information on post-discharge hospital care, read the FCA Hospital Discharge Planning: A Guide for Families and Caregivers fact sheet mentioned above, or take a look at the United Hospital Fund’s information page on Next Step In Care.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/tip-sheet-low-cost-equipment-seniors/,Tip Sheet: Low-Cost Equipment for Seniors,"As more functions move online such as video communications, watching movies or videos, reading publications, playing games, paying bills, shopping, you may want to ask yourself: what online activities are important to you? When selecting equipment, you must first determine what functions you need from a computer or pad. Want to have visual calls with family member or health/social service professionals? You will need a built-in camera. Expect to read the daily newspapers? The size of the screen may be important along with enlarging the type size. Want your equipment to be light weight and mobile to take along when traveling? Smaller laptops or pads would work best.
Everyone’s needs are different and there are a large variety of options to select the one that best fits your needs. A good way to start is to take a look at the Consumer Reports Buying Guide to Computers, Laptops, Pads (https://bit.ly/2W5Hjy2) as an overview of equipment types and functions. Want more information? There are many articles available on this topic online.
Once you have defined your equipment needs, how do you determine what equipment is best? There are numerous reviews of equipment from leading sources such as Consumer Reports consumerreports.com, CNet cnet.com, PC World pcworld.com, PC Magazine pcmag.com, and New York Times thewirecutter.com. Read several, as different brands will tend to pop up consistently. Most reviews will recommend budget choices too. This will give you several brands and equipment types to consider. If you are buying new equipment, this information, along with recommended budget options and watching for sales may yield great equipment at great prices to meet your needs.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/tip-sheet-low-cost-equipment-seniors/,Tip Sheet: Low-Cost Equipment for Seniors,"Another low-cost option is to consider is certified refurbished equipment. Many computer companies refurbish their own equipment – typically older models – and sell them at a deep discount. Other companies offer certified refurbished equipment from a variety of companies. Some will offer a limited warranty for the equipment. Generally, desktops are less expensive than laptops and pads of various sizes are less expensive than laptops. Searching for “refurbished computer desktops or laptops or pads” yields pages of results. There are many resellers on Amazon and eBay too.
Here are some other low-cost equipment options: some of the Internet Service Providers (such as AT&T, Xfinity/Comcast, Verizon, etc.) offering discounted internet service may also sell refurbished equipment with most priced around or under $150. Or they may know of low or no cost equipment options in your community. Some communities have equipment exchanges that offer used and refurbished equipment on loan or for free. To find information about what your community may offer, contact your Aging Disability Resource Center (ADRC), Area Agency on Aging (AAA), Senior Center or Community Living or Disability Program in your community or state. One more tip: many senior centers and libraries offer free basic computer skills classes. Some communities have volunteer programs for tutoring either at a community site or in the home. Ask the organizations listed above for resources for computer skills classes.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/toileting-dementia/,Toileting (for dementia),"Set up the bathroom to make it as easy as possible for the person to get on to and off of the toilet, e.g. having a raised toilet seat and grab bars.
 Notice when the person gives a sign about needing to use the toilet, e.g. agitation, fidgeting, tugging on clothing, wandering, touching the genital area. Have a routine and take the person to the bathroom on a regular schedule, e.g. every two hours. You may have to respond quickly if someone indicates they need to use the bathroom.
 Some people have a regular schedule, especially for bowel movements. If this is so, remind the person to go to the bathroom at the usual time, e.g. right after breakfast.
 If the care receiver needs help removing clothes, help him/her by moving slowly and encouraging him/her to help. Remind the person that they need to pull down their pants before sitting down. Clothes that are easy to remove will help, such as those with elastic waistbands.
 Don’t rush the person; allow time for them to empty their bowel and bladder. It may take a little time to get started. Walk away and come back in a few minutes or stand just outside the door.
 Hand the person toilet paper to use as appropriate. You may need to help get the person started. Using wipes can sometimes be easier than toilet paper if you need to wipe for them.
 Assist as needed to pull pants back up. Sometimes the person will walk away without pulling pants up, which is a fall hazard. Provide as much privacy and modesty as possible.
 Put a sign, preferably with a picture, on the door to the bathroom. Keep the door to the bathroom open so the person can see the toilet.
 Use a commode or urinal by the bed at night so the person doesn’t have to get up and walk to the bathroom, which increases the risk of falls and incontinence. Have a night light if the person does go to the bathroom at night. If a person has urgency when needing to urinate, a commode or urinal by the chair in the living room can also be helpful.
 Sometimes people reduce their fluid intake for fear of not making it to the bathroom. Dehydration can lead to other problems, including urinary tract infections. Make sure they stay hydrated by drinking throughout the day. However, limiting fluid at night might be helpful. Caffeine and alcohol can also increase urgency with urination.
 Using incontinence pads in the underwear might be a way to reassure someone that they don’t have to rush or panic when they have the urge to urinate.
 Flower pots on the floor, wastebaskets, and other containers can be mistaken for a toilet. Remove them from the area the person stays in and from near the toilet. Keep the path to the bathroom clear of obstacles and clutter.

 Save your back. If you feel a strain, get help; don’t do it alone. This is for your safety and for the safety of the person you are trying to move. If you hurt your back, you aren’t going to be able to care for someone else.
 Talk to the person and explain what you are doing and going to do. Talk through the process as you continue with the transfer, ask him/her to help you when able.
 Make sure the person’s legs are on the floor before trying to stand. Use a high, firm chair with arms whenever possible. It is easier to move someone from there than from a sofa or overstuffed chair.
 If someone is in bed, first roll him/her to the side of the bed and help him/her to a sitting position with feet flat on the floor.
 Stand with your feet shoulder width apart with one foot slightly in front of the other. This provides you with your base to support you and your loved one.
 Bend at the knees, not the waist. Your knees will support you and save your back. Flex your knees and hips when lowering someone into a wheelchair, chair, or bed, using the armrests for support when available.
 Place your arms around the person’s waist. Do not have the person put his/her arms around your neck, as that can pull you forward and cause you to loose your balance. If the person feels a need to hold on to something, have him/her put arms around your waist or on your shoulders.
 Have your loved one lean forward before trying to stand. Use a rocking motion to create momentum, if possible. Let him/her know when you are going to start, e.g. you’re going to stand on the count of three. Bring the person as close to your body as you can.
 To swivel someone, use your legs; these muscles are strong and can help you pivot. Do not twist at the waist. Take small steps, keep your back and neck in a straight line.
 Learn to use assistive devices if appropriate, e.g. gait belt, transfer board, draw sheet, Hoyer lift.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/traumatic-brain-injury/,Traumatic Brain Injury,"Traumatic brain injury is considered an Acquired Brain Injury.  It occurs when a blow or jolt to the head results in damage to the brain. TBIs range in severity from mild to severe. It is important to note that no two brains are the same, no two injuries alike.  Therefore, each individual’s brain injury is completely unique. This presents a distinct challenge – unlike any other organ in the body − for both diagnosing specific deficits from the injury, and determining the exact rehabilitation needed.
Mild TBI occurs when a person has a brief change in mental status or loss of consciousness. The most common type of brain injury, a concussion, is classified as a mild traumatic brain injury. Mild TBIs often go undiagnosed, and consequently the person suffering the injury loses out on the benefits of rehabilitation and medical care. Even mild TBIs can have lifelong effects which can be mitigated with proper care.  Severe TBIs may involve loss of consciousness for hours or weeks and can result in permanent disability.
Any TBI, whether mild or severe, can result in short- or long-term disability.
There are many different types of traumatic brain injury, including the following.
Concussions: Most common type of TBI
Penetration injury: Bullets or other objects entering the skull
Contusions: Bleeding from blows to the head
Diffuse axonal injury: Damage from tearing of the brain tissue inside the skull",traumatic-brain-injury

The most common causes of TBI are:
Falls (40.5%);
Unintentional blunt trauma (15.5%);
Motor vehicle accidents (14.3%);
Violence (10%).
TBI is a contributing factor to a third (30.5%) of all injury-related deaths in the United States.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/traumatic-brain-injury/,Traumatic Brain Injury,"It is difficult to predict how well someone who has had a brain injury will recover, partly because there is no test a doctor can give that can reliably predict deficits and recovery. In fact, brain images can appear normal following a mild or moderate brain injury.  The Glasgow Coma Scale is used to determine the initial severity of a brain injury. It is often used at the scene of an accident or in the emergency room. This scale uses eye movements and ability to speak and move other parts of the body to determine the severity of the injury.
Your loved one’s prognosis will depend on many factors, including the severity of the injury, the type of injury, and what parts of the brain have been affected. Prompt diagnosis and treatment will help the rehabilitation process.  A neuropsychological evaluation is useful for determining how the brain injury has affected areas of cognitive function and provides important guidance in determining necessary rehabilitation.

Recovery is typically lengthy — from months to years — because the brain heals slowly and differently than any other organ in the body. Below are tips for the person with a brain injury to help with recovery.
Get lots of rest.
Avoid doing anything that could cause another blow or jolt to the head.
Ask the doctor when it’s safe to drive a car, ride a bike, play sports, or use heavy equipment.
Do not drink alcohol or abuse drugs; these can be particularly hard on an injured brain.
Write things down, use a calendar, maintain a daily journal if possible, and use smartphone alarms to help rebuild memory function.
Get in the habit of regularly repeating the actions and activities that improve functioning.  Repetition is key to rehabilitation as the brain heals.
Ask the doctor to recommend rehabilitation services that can help recovery.
Store important items, such as your keys or your wallet, in the same designated place to keep from losing them.
Keep a steady pace. Take breaks as needed.
Focus on one thing at a time.
Perform tasks in a quiet, non-distracting environment.
If feeling irritable or angry, try relaxation techniques and/or walking away from the situation.
If you are irritable or having trouble concentrating, are you getting enough sleep?
If you are having trouble sleeping, are you drinking energy drinks or alcohol?",traumatic-brain-injury
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/traumatic-brain-injury/,Traumatic Brain Injury,"The goal of rehabilitation is to help your loved one live and function as independently as possible. Rehabilitation helps the body heal and assists the brain in relearning processes so recovery is as efficient as possible. Rehabilitation will also help the person with TBI learn new ways to do things when previous abilities have been lost.
After your loved one’s initial life-saving treatment at the time of the injury, s/he will most likely start a rehabilitation program and will work with a team of specialists. The person with a TBI and his or her family are the most important members of the rehabilitation team. Family members should be included in the rehabilitation and treatment as much as possible. Some of the other professionals who may be part of this team include the following.
Physiatrists or Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR) Physicians: Doctors who are experts in rehabilitation medicine who typically oversee the rehabilitation process.
Neurologists: Doctors who are trained in the diagnosis and treatment of nervous system disorders, including diseases of the brain, seizures, spinal cord, nerves, and muscles.
Occupational, Physical, and Speech-Language Therapists: Therapists who help the person regain cognitive and physical abilities, and communication and behavioral skills.
Neuropsychologists: Specialized psychologists who focus on thinking skills and behavioral issues.
Vocational Rehabilitation Counselors and Job Coaches: Employment professionals who help with regaining job skills and job retention post-injury.
It is important to remember that rehabilitation may take years, and that your loved one will benefit from the ability to receive rehabilitation services throughout this time. Appropriate programs and treatments will also change as your family member’s needs change.
A variety of treatment and rehabilitation programs may help your loved one. Below are some of the different types of rehabilitation facilities.
Acute Rehabilitation: Intensive, in-patient, hospital rehabilitation program
Comprehensive, Long–Term Rehabilitation Program: Provides comprehensive rehabilitation including speech, occupational and physical therapies; psychological counseling; daily living and independent living skills; behavior modification and group socialization; pre-vocational and vocational rehabilitation programs; employment placement with a job coach. Usually an outpatient weekday program; but may be in a rehabilitation facility.
Day Treatment Programs: Provide basic rehabilitation, behavior modification and group socialization during weekdays.
Coma Treatment Centers: Coma-specific medical care
Transitional Living: Nonmedical residential programs that teach independent living and community reintegration skills.
Long-Term Care and Supervised-living Programs: Residential facilities providing care and rehabilitation to people with TBI who are not able to live independently.",traumatic-brain-injury
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/traumatic-brain-injury/,Traumatic Brain Injury,"TBIs can be life altering. Many serious injuries can either be prevented, or at least lessened in severity, with the proper precautions. The following are tips for minimizing the risk of sustaining a TBI.
All passengers should wear lap belts and shoulder harnesses in the car.
Use properly installed infant and child safety seats. A representative of your local police department or highway patrol can show you the proper method of installation.
Avoid drinking and driving or driving under the influence of drugs or medications.
Use helmets for motorcycle and bicycle riding and other recreational sports.
Do not use handheld devices or smartphones when driving or engaged in activity, not even walking.  A smartphone can distract you just long enough to get in an accident, or fall, or get hit in a crosswalk.
To help prevent falls, individuals should:
Use the rails on stairways.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/traumatic-brain-injury/,Traumatic Brain Injury,"When someone suffers a TBI, the entire family is affected. Studies show that caregivers of people who have suffered a brain injury may experience feelings of burden, distress, anxiety, anger, and depression. If you are caring for a partner, spouse, child, relative, or close friend with TBI, it is important to recognize how stressful this situation can be and to seek support services.
Services that may be most helpful to you include in-home assistance (home health aides or personal care assistants), respite care to provide breaks from caregiving, brain injury support groups, and ongoing or short-term counseling to adjust to all of the life changes post-injury. You also may need to ask your support system of family, friends, and community members for help with your loved one’s care, so that you don’t get burned out. (See Family Caregiver Alliance’s fact sheet: Taking Care of YOU: Self-Care for Family Caregivers for additional tips on taking care of yourself.)
In your role as a caregiver, you will probably find that it can be difficult to get appropriate and adequate services for your loved one. It is important to know that you will most likely need to advocate for your loved one and be persistent in your search for assistance. You should use your network of family and friends, as well as professionals, to get tips about available resources and provide support.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/traumatic-brain-injury/,Traumatic Brain Injury,"Due to the high incidence of TBI in the military field, Veteran Affairs (VA) and other sectors of the US military health system have become active in addressing the issues surrounding TBI.
Active duty and reserve service members are at an increased risk of sustaining a TBI compared to their civilian peers. This is a result of several factors, including the specific demographics of the military; in general, young men between the ages of 18 to 24 are at the greatest risk for TBI. This is coupled with an increased risk of being deployed to areas where they are at risk for experiencing blast exposure(s, )and the potential danger of even the most common operational and training activities that are common in the military.
Research conducted in 2005 by the Defense and Veterans Brain Center (DVBIC)( in) found that blasts in combination with (other mechanisms—what does this mean) are a leading cause of TBI for active duty military personnel in war zones. Additionally, people with previous TBIs are at higher risk for suffering subsequent injuries which can be more symptomatic, compared to those with their first TBI.
The VA has implemented an integrated, nationwide system of care for veterans and active duty service members recovering from a TBI. This system is designed to provide care for persons with a TBI as an isolated condition(,) or in the context of additional traumas or comorbidities. It consists of more than 100 VA medical centers, each offering specialized rehabilitation care by an interdisciplinary team.
Various steps have been taken to improve identification and treatment of TBI.
In 2007, the VA initiated a TBI screening for all veterans.
Veterans with a positive TBI screen are referred for a comprehensive evaluation with specialty providers who determine a definitive diagnosis.
An individualized Rehabilitation and Reintegration Treatment Plan of Care is developed for those Veterans that need ongoing rehabilitation services.",traumatic-brain-injury

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/tumor-cerebral-brain-tumor/,Tumor Cerebral (Brain Tumor),"Un tumor cerebral es una agrupación de células que se multiplican fuera de control dentro del cerebro. Denominado también neoplasia, crecimiento, masa o lesión, un tumor cerebral se clasifica como primario o secundario (metastásico) y puede ser benigno o maligno.
Los tumores cerebrales primarios se desarrollan y generalmente permanecen en el cerebro.
Los tumores cerebrales secundarios, o tumores cerebrales metastásicos, son cánceres que se desarrollan en otras partes del cuerpo y se propagan al cerebro. Los cánceres más comunes que se diseminan al cerebro son los cánceres de pulmón, mama, melanoma, colon y riñón.
Los tumores cerebrales malignos crecen rápidamente y comprimen y/o invaden el tejido cerebral sano.
Los tumores cerebrales benignos generalmente no crecen con rapidez. Sin embargo, incluso los tumores benignos pueden poner en peligro la vida debido a su ubicación en el cerebro.
Tener la información en cuanto al diagnóstico de un tumor cerebral es una cuestión difícil para las familias, pero también hay razones para tener esperanza. Se ha logrado un progreso significativo en cuanto a la comprensión médica de los cánceres en general, y los avances en el conocimiento de la biología de los tumores cerebrales están conduciendo a un tratamiento más efectivo. Muchas de estas opciones de tratamiento se analizan a continuación.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/tumor-cerebral-brain-tumor/,Tumor Cerebral (Brain Tumor),"Según el Central Brain Tumor Registry de los Estados Unidos (CBTRUS), cada año se diagnostican aproximadamente 87 000 casos nuevos de tumores cerebrales primarios en los EE. UU. El 30% de estos tumores son tumores cerebrales malignos. Los tumores cerebrales malignos primarios representan el 2,4 por ciento de todas las muertes por cáncer en los EE. UU. Casi el 70 % de todos los tumores cerebrales primarios son benignos y se pueden tratar con éxito. Cada año se diagnostican tumores cerebrales metastásicos a 150 000 personas más. La frecuencia de los tumores cerebrales metastásicos parece estar aumentando: las mejoras en el tratamiento de cánceres primarios en otras partes del cuerpo permiten que las personas vivan más tiempo, sin embargo, las células cancerosas no identificadas pueden llegar al cerebro. Existen más de 100 tipos de tumores cerebrales. Ciertos tipos de tumores cerebrales primarios ocurren con mayor frecuencia en niños, mientras que otros ocurren con mayor frecuencia en adultos. Los tumores cerebrales en adultos suelen aparecer entre los 40 y los 60 años de edad, y son un poco más frecuentes en los hombres.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/tumor-cerebral-brain-tumor/,Tumor Cerebral (Brain Tumor),"A medida que las células tumorales se multiplican dentro del cerebro, estas pueden presionar, irritar y/o deteriorar el tejido cerebral sano.

debilidad
problemas visuales
dolor o entumecimiento
problemas de movimiento

náuseas o vómitos
Los tumores cerebrales pueden causar sensación de cansancio o fatiga. Además, los tumores cerebrales pueden causar problemas con las capacidades de la memoria, la lectura y el habla. Los síntomas experimentados a menudo están relacionados con la ubicación del tumor. No todos presentan los mimos síntomas. Alrededor de un tercio de las personas con tumores cerebrales no presentan ningún síntoma.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/tumor-cerebral-brain-tumor/,Tumor Cerebral (Brain Tumor),"Los tumores cerebrales se diagnostican con mayor frecuencia cuando un paciente ha desarrollado un síntoma que hace que busque atención médica. Los síntomas comunes en el momento del diagnóstico incluyen dolores de cabeza, convulsiones, debilidad, cambios en el habla, la visión, el pensamiento o la personalidad. Después de que un médico realiza la valoración al paciente, ordena una prueba de imagen, como una resonancia magnética (IRM). Las imágenes ayudan a visualizar la causa del síntoma. Las imágenes muestran el tamaño, la ubicación y los efectos exactos que una lesión está produciendo en el cerebro. Las pruebas de imagen no proporcionan un diagnóstico definitivo. Si se sospecha un tumor, se recomienda un procedimiento quirúrgico, si es posible, para obtener una muestra de tejido con el fin de determinar exactamente el tipo de células o tumores. Es a partir de la muestra de tejido que se realiza un diagnóstico.
Los tumores cerebrales se pueden diagnosticar y evaluar mediante una combinación de estos diferentes tipos de procedimientos:
Imágenes por resonancia magnética (IRM)
Tomografía computarizada (TC)
Tomografía por emisión de positrones (PET)
Biopsia
La resonancia magnética, la tomografía computarizada y la tomografía por emisión de positrones son formas de tomar imágenes del interior del cuerpo. No requieren cirugía. Estos procedimientos se analizan con más detalle a continuación.
Imágenes por resonancia magnética (IRM)
Las IRMs se recomiendan como el método predilecto para obtener imágenes de un tumor debido a la alta calidad de las imágenes producidas. Las resonancias magnéticas utilizan un imán extremadamente fuerte para producir imágenes. Con la resonancia magnética con contraste, primero se le inyecta al paciente un tinte que hace que el tejido normal y el tumoral se muestren de manera diferente. Si su ser querido requiere una resonancia magnética, asegúrese de informarle al médico sobre cualquier antecedente de alergias o reacciones a medicamentos. Debido a que la resonancia magnética utiliza un imán, no se puede introducir ningún metal en la sala mientras se realiza la resonancia magnética. Los pacientes que tienen marcapasos y/o implantes metálicos no pueden someterse a una resonancia magnética.
Tomografía computarizada (TC)
Se puede usar una tomografía computarizada para pacientes que no pueden someterse a una resonancia magnética debido a la presencia de marcapasos, implantes metálicos, alergias o claustrofobia.
Las máquinas de tomografía computarizada toman múltiples radiografías de pequeñas áreas del cerebro desde diferentes ángulos . Luego, la computadora combina los escaneos para crear una imagen tridimensional detallada.
Debido a que el yodo se puede usar como agente de contraste para mejorar la imagen, debe informarle al médico si su ser querido sufre de alergias, diabetes, asma, afección cardíaca, problemas renales o afección de la tiroides.
Tomografía por emisión de positrones (PET)
Los escaneos PET a veces se utilizan además de una resonancia magnética o una tomografía computarizada para evaluar los tumores cerebrales. Después de recibir tratamiento para un tumor cerebral, las tomografías por emisión de positrones también se pueden usar para diferenciar el crecimiento de un nuevo tumor del tejido cicatricial o la necrosis (células muertas por la radiación).
Biopsia
La biopsia es la extirpación quirúrgica de una pequeña parte del tejido tumoral con la intención específica de obtener un diagnóstico. El tejido se estudia para confirmar el tipo de tumor y ayudar al equipo de atención médica a diseñar un plan de tratamiento.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/tumor-cerebral-brain-tumor/,Tumor Cerebral (Brain Tumor),"Se considera una variedad de opciones en el tratamiento de los tumores cerebrales. Su equipo de atención médica diseñará un plan para ayudar a tratar el tumor y aliviar cualquier síntoma que pueda estar causando el tumor cerebral.
Los siguientes profesionales de la salud pueden formar parte del equipo de tratamiento:
Neurólogo: un médico que se especializa en el tratamiento de pacientes con enfermedades del cerebro y otras partes del sistema nervioso.
Neurocirujano (o cirujano del cerebro): un médico que se especializa en cirugías del cerebro y el sistema nervioso general.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/tumor-cerebral-brain-tumor/,Tumor Cerebral (Brain Tumor),"La primera alternativa al tratamiento, de acuerdo a la localización y el tamaño del tumor, es la extirpación quirúrgica de la mayor parte posible de la lesión (también llamada resección). La cirugía también puede reducir los síntomas causados por la inflamación del cerebro. La mejora de las técnicas quirúrgicas en los últimos años ha hecho que la cirugía sea mucho más segura; sin embargo, la cirugía siempre tiene riesgos que usted y su ser querido deben consultar con el oncólogo y el neurocirujano. Al decidir si la cirugía es lo apropiado para su ser querido, su médico considerará el tamaño, la localización y el tipo de tumor, así como la salud general y el historial médico del paciente.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/tumor-cerebral-brain-tumor/,Tumor Cerebral (Brain Tumor),"La radioterapia es el uso de rayos X indoloros que destruyen las células tumorales haciéndolas incapaces de reproducirse. La radiación se puede usar después de la cirugía para evitar que el tumor regrese (recurrencia) al destruir las células tumorales que no se pudieron extirpar por completo. En los casos en que la cirugía no sea una opción, se puede utilizar la radioterapia en lugar de la cirugía para destruir el tejido tumoral o aliviar los síntomas. A continuación, se describen diferentes tipos de radioterapia:
Radioterapia de cerebro completo (WBRT) suministra una dosis uniforme de radiación a todo el cerebro. La radioterapia de cerebro completo se utiliza cuando el cáncer ha hecho metástasis en el cerebro y cuando hay varios tumores presentes. Las ventajas de la radioterapia de cerebro completo son: puede tratar tumores de tamaños grandes y pequeños, muchos tumores al mismo tiempo, y tumores profundos en el cerebro que no se pueden extirpar mediante cirugía. La radioterapia de cerebro completo a menudo se usa para reducir el riesgo de recurrencia del tumor después de la cirugía.
Radioterapia externa convencional es la forma más común de radioterapia y se usa para tratar tumores cerebrales primarios. Es un método más preciso que WBRT. Los haces son dirigidos al tumor rodeando un pequeño borde de tejido adicional alrededor del tumor para preservar el tejido cerebral sano. La radioterapia externa convencional es indolora y, por lo general, se administra en sesiones de 15 minutos durante varias semanas.
Radiocirugía estereotáctica es una forma más dirigida de radioterapia y, en realidad, no es una cirugía. Se denomina “radiocirugía” ya que es muy precisa y dirigida. El equipo utilizado para la radiocirugía generalmente se conoce por su nombre de marca, como Gamma Knife®, XKnife® o CyberKnifeTM. Esta forma de terapia administra una dosis más alta de radiación a un tumor pequeño (generalmente de 1,5 pulgadas o menos de diámetro) en una sola sesión de tratamiento. Debido a que esta forma de radiación se dirige al tumor con mayor precisión, es menos probable que dañe el tejido sano. A menudo se usa para tratar tumores metastásicos pequeños y recurrencias de tumores pequeños. La radiocirugía estereotáctica trata solo los tumores que se pueden detectar en las tomografías computarizadas o las resonancias magnéticas.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/tumor-cerebral-brain-tumor/,Tumor Cerebral (Brain Tumor),"La quimioterapia es el uso de medicamentos especiales para destruir las células tumorales. Algunos medicamentos de quimioterapia se administran por vía oral; otros se administran por inyección. En algunos casos, es posible que sea necesario administrar quimioterapia sin interrupción durante un largo periodo de tiempo. En este caso, se puede colocar una bomba o un catéter debajo de la piel para administrar los medicamentos.
Existe una capa químicamente protectora alrededor del cerebro llamada barrera hematoencefálica. Esta barrera puede evitar que los medicamentos o la quimioterapia administrados por vía oral o por inyección lleguen al cerebro. Para resolver este problema, se están desarrollando nuevas formas de administrar quimioterapia para administrar el fármaco directamente al tumor. Un ejemplo de esto son los implantes de obleas de quimioterapia que se implantan quirúrgicamente en el sitio del tumor y administran el tratamiento de forma constante.
También se están desarrollando nuevos medicamentos que se enfocan en anomalías específicas que se encuentran en las células tumorales. Siendo conocidas como “terapias dirigidas”, esta nueva generación de medicamentos forma la base de la medicina personalizada al dirigirse a los genes (proteínas), los receptores y las enzimas que son relativos a las células tumorales. Los medicamentos dirigidos funcionan bloqueando las señales celulares que hacen que las células tumorales crezcan, o enviando señales para que las células tumorales se destruyan a sí mismas.
Debido a que la quimioterapia puede afectar tanto a las células sanas como a las células tumorales, pueden ocurrir efectos secundarios. Estos varían según el tipo de medicamento y las características del individuo.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/tumor-cerebral-brain-tumor/,Tumor Cerebral (Brain Tumor),"La inmunoterapia es un tipo de tratamiento anticancerígeno que estimula el propio sistema inmunitario del cuerpo para combatir o eliminar las células cancerosas. Existen varios tipos de inmunoterapia, incluida la monoclonal anticuerpos y terapias agnósticas tumorales, inmunoterapias inespecíficas, terapia con virus oncolíticos, terapia con células T y vacunas contra el cáncer. Dependiendo del tipo de células cancerosas que causan el tumor cerebral, se pueden recomendar diferentes tipos de inmunoterapias. Existen varias inmunoterapias que ahora están aprobadas para tratar cánceres sistémicos que pueden hacer metástasis en el cerebro.
Actualmente existen dos opciones de inmunoterapia aprobadas por la FDA para los cánceres primarios del cerebro y del sistema nervioso central. Son anticuerpos dirigidos;
Bevacizumab (Avastin): un anticuerpo monoclonal que se dirige a la vía VEGF/VEGFR e inhibe el crecimiento de los vasos sanguíneos del tumor. Este medicamento está aprobado para tratar el glioblastoma recurrente.
Dinutuximab (Unituxin): un anticuerpo monoclonal que se dirige a la vía GD2; aprobado para el tratamiento de primera línea del neuroblastoma pediátrico de alto riesgo.
Se están probando inmunoterapias adicionales en ensayos clínicos en todo el mundo.",brain-tumor

Ha sido aprobada por la FDA para el tratamiento del glioblastoma. Los TTF requieren energía eléctrica o un paquete de baterías y el paciente debe usar una gorra de “arrays”, que transmiten los campos eléctricos alternos a través de las células tumorales. Tan solo la irritación leve de la piel donde se colocan las arrays en el cuero cabelludo, la terapia no tiene efectos secundarios sistémicos.",brain-tumor
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/tumor-cerebral-brain-tumor/,Tumor Cerebral (Brain Tumor),"Los siguientes tratamientos paliativos pueden ayudar con los síntomas provocados por un tumor cerebral, como dolores de cabeza y náuseas, aunque en realidad no ayudarán a extirpar el tumor ni a sanar a su ser querido:
Esteroides (Corticosteroides)
Los tumores cerebrales a menudo producen hinchazón e inflamación dentro del cráneo. Esto puede causar dolores de cabeza, somnolencia y otros problemas de salud. Los esteroides (corticosteroides), por lo general dexametasona, reducen la hinchazón rápidamente y pueden mejorar el funcionamiento de la mente. La mayoría de los pacientes se sienten mejor con medicamentos esteroides a corto plazo; sin embargo, algunos necesitarán tomar esteroides durante más de unos meses para controlar los síntomas. Si su ser querido toma esteroides como parte del plan de tratamiento, asegúrese de informar al médico o enfermero(a) sobre cualquier cambio que pueda notar en su salud. Los esteroides pueden causar efectos secundarios como aumento de peso, aumento del apetito, insomnio e irritabilidad. Además, su ser querido debe hablar con el médico si decide dejar de tomar esteroides puesto que dejar de tomarlos de forma repentina puede ser peligroso.
Medicamentos anticonvulsivos (anticonvulsionantes)
Se pueden administrar estos medicamentos para ayudar a prevenir las convulsiones. Estos medicamentos se llaman medicamentos anticonvulsivos o anticonvulsionantes. Existen varios tipos de medicamentos anticonvulsivos disponibles tales como Keppra, Tegretol, Trileptal, Lamictal, Dilantin, Depakote, Neurontin y fenobarbitol. Si su ser querido está tomando un medicamento anticonvulsivo como parte del plan de tratamiento y, ya sea que no tenga efecto, o cause efectos secundarios desagradables, el médico puede prescribir un medicamento diferente.
Terapias complementarias
El tratamiento médico de su ser querido se planifica cuidadosamente para controlar la enfermedad y reducir los síntomas tanto como sea posible. Muchas personas buscan terapias complementarias para sentirse mejor y sobrellevar el estrés causado por el cáncer. Estas terapias no pretenden reemplazar la terapia médica, sin embargo, pueden ayudar a su ser querido a controlar sus síntomas. Las terapias complementarias para el cáncer pueden incluir el control del estrés, la relajación y terapia de imágenes, la meditación, el apoyo grupal, el asesoramiento familiar, la nutrición, la medicina naturista, los masajes, la acupuntura y la formación educativa. Algunos centros y hospitales oncológicos ofrecen estos servicios para las personas que padecen cáncer, sus familias y sus cuidadores.",brain-tumor

Debido a la posible debilidad muscular, cambios en el equilibrio y otras consideraciones, las siguientes adaptaciones pueden ayudar a que su hogar sea más seguro para su ser querido:
Instalar pasamanos en ducha y tina de baño.
Conseguir una silla de ducha
Si la casa tiene más de un piso, considere colocar la cama de su ser querido en la planta baja
Considere conseguir una cama de hospital
Considere conseguir un inodoro portátil
P: ¿Cómo puedo hacer frente a las emociones en la tarea?
Como cuidador, puede optar por recibir asesoramiento para aprender cómo ayudar a su ser querido a lidiar con los cambios mentales que está experimentando y, lo que es más importante, cómo lidiar con sus propias reacciones ante los cambios de su ser querido. Este es un momento difícil para todos los involucrados. Si bien la enfermedad puede acercar a las personas, también puede causar tensión, infelicidad y estrés. Damos algunas sugerencias para hacer frente a la tarea:
Busque familiares y amigos que estén dispuestos a comprometerse a ayudarle a cuidar a su ser querido.
Involucre a esas personas en una comunidad solidaria que brinde apoyo práctico y emocional para usted y su ser querido.
Identifique sus fortalezas y las fortalezas de los demás en su comunidad solidaria.
¡Tómese tiempo libre de forma regular! El agotamiento del cuidador es un factor de preocupación importante.
Participe en grupos y organizaciones externos que brinden apoyo e información para las personas con cáncer y sus cuidadores.",brain-tumor

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/vascular-dementia/,Vascular Dementia,"Vascular dementia is a medical term that describes a decline in cognitive abilities including memory, planning, reasoning, and judgment. When blood flow is reduced to any region of the brain, it becomes damaged quickly and recovers slowly, if at all. Damaged brain tissue causes the dementia symptoms. When symptoms are severe, they impair a person’s daily functioning and may affect their ability to live independently. In that case, family caregivers may need to help manage their loved one’s care.
Symptoms of vascular dementia can begin gradually or abruptly. For example, memory and thinking problems often appear immediately after a patient has a stroke. However, having a stroke does not necessarily mean that a person will have dementia: The severity of the stroke and location in the brain determines if thinking skills are significantly affected. On the other hand, some individuals will exhibit gradual and subtle changes due to chronic cerebrovascular disease (i.e., conditions that affect the blood vessels in the brain). Vascular dementia frequently occurs with other types of dementia, such as Alzheimer’s disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies. The additional presence of vascular disease in the brain often makes symptoms of other brain diseases worse. ",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/vascular-dementia/,Vascular Dementia,"Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease. Incidence estimates range from 10-20% of all dementias among older adults. Vascular dementia results from reduced blood supply to the brain due to diseased blood vessels. To be healthy and function properly, neurons require adequate oxygen, glucose, and other nutrients provided by blood that is delivered to the brain through a complex system of vessels (the vascular system). If this vascular system becomes compromised by weak or blocked vessels, then blood supply will not be adequate and brain cells and tissue will be damaged and/or die.
Certain diseases and conditions that narrow or cause long-term damage to blood vessels can increase one’s risk of developing vascular dementia because they may lead to stroke or multiple subcortical infarcts (tissue death due to inadequate blood supply). These conditions may result from aging, genetic factors or from various medical disorders that contribute to underlying cardiovascular diseases. They include:
high blood pressure
hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis)
diabetes
sleep apnea
high cholesterol
obesity
smoking
atrial fibrillation
physical inactivity and poor diet.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/vascular-dementia/,Vascular Dementia,"Vascular dementia can be divided into two types: post-stroke dementia and multi-infarct dementia (also known as subcortical vascular dementia).
POST-STROKE DEMENTIA

Symptoms are most obvious when they arise suddenly following a stroke, resulting in the blood supply to the brain being suddenly interrupted due to a blocked artery. This disruption can lead to damage or death of brain tissue. Not all stroke victims develop dementia; it is estimated that approximately 20% of stroke patients develop post-stroke dementia within six months. Post-stroke dementia can result in physical symptoms (for example, paralysis or weakness of a limb) and/or problems with vision or speech. Symptoms depend on what area and how much of the brain is affected.
MULTI-INFARCT DEMENTIA

This type of dementia results from a series of mini-strokes in vessels located deep within the brain (i.e., subcortical). These mini-strokes may not lead to any sudden obvious onset of symptoms; however, even these “silent brain infarctions” still increase the risk of dementia, a result of disease of the brain’s blood vessels. Over time, the effects of this damage can result in dementia. Progression is referred to as “step-wise” because symptoms worsen after any additional mini-strokes and then remain the same for a time. Symptoms that may develop include changes in reasoning and other thinking skills such as memory, as well as mood and behavior problems, including depression and apathy.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/vascular-dementia/,Vascular Dementia,"Symptoms differ depending on what part and how much of the brain is affected, and can overlap with those of other types of dementia. Symptoms are likely to be more gradual and less dramatic in multi-infarct than in post-stroke dementia. For example, in multi-infarct dementia a gradual decline in some aspects of speech and language may be noticed, whereas immediately following a stroke there can be a sudden change in speech.
Vascular dementia does generally progress, but the speed and pattern of cognitive decline, motor skills slowing, and mood changes can vary. Some individuals may experience memory loss, whereas others may exhibit changes primarily in mood and behavior.
Like all dementias, individuals in later stages will show overall cognitive changes and will depend on others for care. Symptoms common in both post-stroke and multi-infarct type dementia can include:
confusion and difficulty problem-solving
trouble paying attention and concentrating
problems with learning and memory
poor planning and organizing 
changes in mood including loss of interest in regular activities
trouble finding the right word
motor symptoms including clumsiness and slow or unsteady gait disturbance.
Family caregivers may find it difficult to know how to provide help when symptoms are so variable. Getting a definitive diagnosis will make it easier to provide care now and in the future.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/vascular-dementia/,Vascular Dementia,"Concerns about vascular dementia should be raised with a physician. Early diagnosis is important, as it provides access to treatment, advice regarding planning for the future, and possible recommendations for lifestyle changes that may slow down the progression of the underlying disease. Recommended lifestyle changes may include following a healthier diet, getting physically active, quitting smoking, and quitting or decreasing alcohol consumption.
Depression frequently coexists with vascular dementia and can contribute to, or worsen, vascular-based cognitive symptoms. Medical conditions that may present symptoms similar to depression (fatigue, irritability, insomnia, decreased appetite, anxiety) caused by vascular disease should first be ruled out.
A thorough medical examination for vascular dementia can include a variety of different tests and studies. A physician will conduct a full medical history and likely order blood tests to rule out reversible causes of cognitive decline, such as low Vitamin B12, or hypothyroidism. Often individuals are referred to a neurologist for more specialized examination of motor functioning, as well as reflexes, sensation, and gait (manner of walking). A brain scan (e.g., CT, MRI, MRA) is often ordered in the examination stage to identify the presence of strokes or disease in the blood vessels.
Some individuals may also be referred for a carotid ultrasound if there is concern about blockages in these specific arteries. Referral to a specialist for evaluation of thinking skills such as memory and processing speed is typical and an important component of the evaluation. The specialist consulted may be a psychiatrist or neuropsychologist. Evaluating independent function is important to determine if the cognitive difficulties are impacting day-to-day activities enough to indicate a diagnosis of dementia. Patients who have cognitive decline but intact daily functioning might instead be given a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).
If the medical examination indicates the person has dementia or MCI due to vascular disease of the brain, the diagnosis will be made and discussion about the next steps will be provided.
Vascular dementia can be difficult to differentiate from other forms of dementia because there is frequently an overlap in symptoms. Also, many individuals with dementia have both vascular disease and another brain disease such as Alzheimer’s or Lewy Body Dementia, and therefore have a “mixed dementia.” Mixed dementia may be diagnosed less frequently than vascular dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, but many researchers believe it is quite common and deserves greater attention because the presence of two or more types of dementia-related conditions is likely to have a more severe impact on the brain and cognitive functioning than one type alone. ",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/vascular-dementia/,Vascular Dementia,"There is no specific or approved treatment for vascular dementia. Controlling medical conditions that impact cardiovascular health is recommended to prevent further decline. For example, medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol, heart disease, and diabetes can be prescribed. Aspirin or other drugs may be prescribed to prevent clots from forming in blood vessels.
An individual diagnosed with vascular dementia will also be encouraged to incorporate a healthy lifestyle. A diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables, fish, and limited fat and salt is important. Exercising and avoiding smoking and alcohol can reduce the risk of further strokes or vascular brain damage.
Research suggests that medications currently available for treating Alzheimer’s disease can, for some, be effective in treating symptoms of vascular dementia. These drugs may slow progression of cognitive symptoms such as memory decline, but they will not cure the disease or prevent additional deterioration. These drugs include the class of drugs called cholinesterase inhibitors and include donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), and galantamine (Razadyne). It’s important to consult with a physician about starting these medications, as there are common side effects that need to be discussed and monitored.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/vascular-dementia/,Vascular Dementia,"There are many ways to help your family member or friend maximize his or her independence and cope with the cognitive symptoms of vascular dementia. Unlike Alzheimer’s disease, individuals with vascular dementia might better remember things in their daily life when repetition and context are provided. Likewise, simple cues can jog recall when remembering is difficult for the person. Structured and predictable routines can be helpful. Assistive devices and technology, such as pill boxes or electronic reminders on a phone, might be useful as well.
Breaking down complex—now overwhelming—tasks into smaller and more manageable steps will make them easier to complete. It’s also useful to simplify explanations and directions. As the disease progresses, even tasks learned years ago, like shaving or brushing teeth, may require step-by-step directions.
Problems with attention can make  focusing and concentrating more difficult for your family member. Ensuring an environment that is not overly busy or noisy will make it easier to pay attention. Multi-tasking can be particularly difficult. Individuals with vascular dementia might have an easier time completing tasks when they focus on a single activity at a time, instead of dividing their attention between multiple tasks. 
Changes in mood and personality can accompany cognitive changes in vascular dementia, and often, these changes are the most distressing for caregivers. Approaching these behaviors with the understanding that they are a result of changes in the brain, as opposed to a choice that a healthy person would make, can help guide how to best respond and manage them. Some specific tips include:
Identify possible reasons for the behavior change. Examine the situation to determine if there was some behavioral trigger or antecedent to the change. For example, consider when, where, with whom, and what the person with dementia is being asked to do. This may promote a deeper understanding of their response/reaction and help you identify ways to calm the individual and decrease future disruptions. Keep in mind that the person may be less capable of expressing their distress adequately if they are experiencing pain or discomfort. Caregivers can often use the individual’s behaviors as indications of distress.
Consideration of safety concerns can guide your response. While many behaviors can be distressing and bothersome for caregivers, they are not necessarily a safety risk for someone with vascular dementia. Alternatively, some behaviors can be potentially dangerous for the individual with vascular dementia and/or the caregiver. For example, aggression and wandering may require immediate intervention, such as installing locks on the door and developing a safety plan. Disruptive but not dangerous behaviors, such as repetitive questioning or pacing, may respond to a softer approach, such as engaging in another activity as a distraction.
Practice patience, acceptance, and flexibility. Remember that emotional outbursts and personality changes are due to underlying brain disease and are not a deliberate response or reaction to you as the caregiver. When behavior problems become overwhelming to the family, it’s critical to seek out support. Caregiver support groups are helpful, offering a space to vent, grieve, and gain practical advice from others who are experiencing similar challenges. Exploring other sources of respite, such as adult day programs, can also be beneficial, both for the individual and for caregivers.",dementia

However, more serious changes to eyesight also occur as one ages.
People of any age who have a stroke, traumatic brain injury, or a brain tumor may experience many physical changes, including vision loss. The loss may be temporary or permanent.
Most older adults experiencing low vision, however, will be affected by one of four conditions: macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataracts, and diabetic retinopathy.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/vision-loss-and-blindness/,Vision Loss and Blindness,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss for people over 50 in the Western world. There are two types of macular degeneration, the wet form and the dry form.
Dry macular degeneration is the more common form of the condition and develops slowly. Vision loss may be mild for years, although it will eventually worsen. It may also lead to wet macular degeneration. With dry macular degeneration, small fatty deposits called drusen gather on the macula, which is a part of the eye that helps us see sharp details.
Wet macular degeneration is more severe and accounts for about 10 percent of cases of macular degeneration. It is caused by the growth of abnormal blood vessels under the macula. These blood vessels leak blood into the tissue at the back of the eye, producing scar tissue and rapid changes to the macula. Wet macular degeneration often develops very quickly and causes sudden loss of vision in the center of the eye.
One unusual effect of rapid vision loss is called Charles Bonnet Syndrome. This condition, which sometimes accompanies macular degeneration, produces hallucinations. These hallucinations do not reflect mental illness or another neurological disorder; they are, in effect, occasional visual “additions” to limited sight, and may even be pleasant—flowers, animals, faces. An estimated 10 to 40 percent of those with AMD experience this syndrome",vision-loss-blindness
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/vision-loss-and-blindness/,Vision Loss and Blindness,"There is no cure for macular degeneration, but early detection means more treatment options may be available and research into the condition is ongoing. While there are currently no direct treatments for dry macular degeneration, there are some recommendations to follow that may help slow the progress of either the wet or dry form. These include stopping smoking, eating lots of vegetables and fruits, especially dark green leafy vegetables (such as spinach, kale, and collards) and taking, with your doctor’s approval, supplements with zinc, copper and anti-oxidant vitamins (vitamins C, E and beta carotene). The National Eye Institute is studying other supplements that can affect eye health including omega-3 (fish oil), lutein, and zeaxanthin.
Wet macular degeneration can be treated, and early detection and treatment may prevent severe vision loss. Medications currently available are delivered to the eye by injection. These treatments help reduce the growth of abnormal blood vessels and help preserve, or in some cases improve, the vision that remains. Other options, used less frequently, include photodynamic or laser surgery; additional options are under investigation. For most people, therapies require multiple treatments, and can result in slower loss of vision.",vision-loss-blindness

If your loved one experiences the symptoms of low vision, such as blurred vision or sensitivity to glare, he or she should seek the care of a low vision specialist—an optometrist or ophthalmologist with particular expertise in this area. (See the Resources section to find a specialist.) This specialist will do a vision assessment and then make a referral for specific treatment, vision-related training, and/or assistive devices.
It is important that your loved one continues to see the vision specialist every year to catch any changes in vision. The sooner such changes are found and possibly treated, the better the chance that your loved one will still be able to retain his or her vision and live as independently as possible.",vision-loss-blindness

Rehabilitation services include adaptive living, orientation and mobility training (including the possibility of using a cane to move around in public), vision training, and assistive devices.
Because some people with low vision do still retain usable vision, it’s helpful to work with a vision rehabilitation specialist to learn how to best use the vision they have. If your loved one has macular degeneration, for example, and has lost vision in the center of his or her eye, the vision rehabilitation specialist will teach how to best use the peripheral vision that remains.
Rehabilitation services are provided by state and private agencies serving blind and visually impaired persons. You can locate these services by checking your local telephone directory, or calling the American Foundation for the Blind for a referral (see Resources section for more information).",vision-loss-blindness
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/vision-loss-and-blindness/,Vision Loss and Blindness,"There are many inexpensive and relatively simple changes that you can make in the house to help your loved one remain safe and comfortable.
Improve lighting and reduce glare
Adding more lamps and lighting throughout the house will help your loved one use their remaining vision effectively. Consider adding gooseneck lamps in places where extra light is needed for such tasks as writing checks, cooking, or reading. Illuminate stairs, especially top and bottom steps. Install night lights in key places.
It is useful to find out which types of bulbs provide the best kind of lighting to help your loved one see most clearly. Depending on the type of vision loss, different qualities of light (more white or yellow, for example) might make it easier to see.
Reducing glare is important as well. Installing blinds or shades on windows in the house and wearing anti-glare sunglasses and visors outdoors will be beneficial.
Accentuate dark and light contrasts throughout the home
Many alterations are simply ways to make things show up more easily. Use paint or tape in contrasting colors to help your loved one find and use items throughout the house. For example, having outlet or switch plate covers in colors that contrast with wall paint makes light switches or thermostats easier to find. Similarly, using plates, cups, and utensils in a color that contrasts with the countertop and table aids in food preparation and dining. Use towels in the bathroom that do not blend with the wall color to make them easy to find. Install handrails along the staircase in colors that contrast with walls to help prevent falls.
Organizing the house
Organize cupboards and specify exact locations for important things. If the cereal is always on the middle shelf of the pantry, for example, your loved one will not need to strain to try to determine if it is cereal or something else. Set up consistent places for mail, keys, and other important items.
Use markers to print large labels for such everyday items as cleaning or cooking supplies (and be sure to keep cleaning supplies separate from food storage areas). Clearly mark stove dials and label all medications.
It’s extremely important to keep your living space clear of obstacles and hazards. While large area rugs can be useful to define rooms, remove throw rugs and unnecessary furnishings that clutter walking paths to help eliminate tripping hazards. Any measure you can take to reduce the danger of falls is helpful.",vision-loss-blindness
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/vision-loss-and-blindness/,Vision Loss and Blindness,"Many kinds of assistive devices can be of great help and often can be found at drugstores or specialty shops or through websites that specialize in these products. Some of the most useful are:
Magnifiers 
Very effective for those with low vision and come in many different sizes and styles. Different kinds of magnifiers will help accomplish different tasks.
Penlights 
Useful whenever more concentrated light might help your loved one see or read something. Like magnifiers, you might want to keep several penlights around to help in different situations.
Electronics 
Closed circuit televisions (CCTVs ) are very useful for those with low vision. CCTVs look something like a computer but consist of a camera and screen. An object can be placed under the camera which magnifies it, and then displays it much larger on the screen. This makes reading and writing easier.
Audio products 
Many audio products can help with everyday tasks or hobbies. These include “talking” clocks, calculators, watches, navigation tools, books and more.

Telephones come with large dials and buttons in various forms; computers offer large print, large screens, and special keyboards. Many other ingenious devices have been developed to help those with visual limitations; see the Resources section of this fact sheet and the Family Caregiver Alliance fact sheet on Assistive Technology for more information.",vision-loss-blindness
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/vision-loss-and-blindness/,Vision Loss and Blindness,"Vision rehabilitation services introduce techniques to make travel as independent as possible. This is called orientation and mobility training, and will include learning how to best use existing vision. Other techniques include using a white cane, and learning how to better use one’s hearing while walking. While not everyone is eager to use a cane, if your loved one is receptive, this can be a very useful tool to maintain independence.
To assist someone while walking, use the sighted guide technique: walk a half step in front of them and have them hold your arm just above the elbow. You can also announce any hazards, like steps or holes in the sidewalk, to help them (and you!) avoid falling. Other tips:
Carry magnifiers and/or penlights when shopping or going to appointments outside the home.
Fold each denomination of dollar bill a different way to help your loved one shop or use public transportation.
When needed, let bus drivers, shopkeepers, or others know that your loved one has low vision to make traveling outside the home safe.",vision-loss-blindness
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/vision-loss-and-blindness/,Vision Loss and Blindness,"Medicare covers only certain low-vision care, including some surgery for glaucoma and for intraocular lenses used in cataract surgery. It also pays for treatment for certain patients with age-related macular degeneration in which the central part of the eye deteriorates.
Some nonprofit groups also provide financial assistance to needy patients with low vision. The Resources section of this fact sheet lists organizations which provide financial aid for eye care or assistive devices.",vision-loss-blindness
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/vision-loss-and-blindness/,Vision Loss and Blindness,"Anyone diagnosed with a condition causing vision loss may experience many difficult emotions, including grief, shock, anger, and depression. These feelings may last only a short time or could persist for years. Losing the ability to drive may be an emotional blow, and your loved one may worry about whether he or she will still be able to live independently. Vision loss might be one of the first definite signs of aging that people experience, making them feel vulnerable or frail.
Acknowledging these negative emotions is important. As a caregiver, you may also have concerns about how your relationship with your loved one will change. You might be worried about increased dependence. You might be unhappy about being asked to take on tasks that you do not want to do. You will most likely experience emotions about your loved one’s vision loss that you will need to address. Being open and honest about these feelings will help you move past them and allow you to continue as a caregiver.
Most people with vision loss do find that their confidence about living with reduced eyesight increases over time. By participating in rehabilitation training and trying the techniques taught there, your loved one will likely begin to trust their new skills and feel better about the future.",vision-loss-blindness
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/vision-loss-and-blindness/,Vision Loss and Blindness,"To help your loved one deal with the challenges of reduced vision, you’ll want to be as informed, supportive, and caring as possible. Learning as much as you can about the condition and best adaptation strategies will help reduce early feelings of despair or fear, and move to acceptance and confidence. Counseling and support groups can be significant sources of help. Finally, by treating the vision loss as a family issue, you will help your loved one feel supported as he or she adjusts to life with vision loss.
It might not be obvious where or when your loved one needs assistance. Although it’s hard for any of us to ask for help, communicating openly and clearly is important. Encourage your loved one to be specific about the kinds of tasks that she or he finds challenging and exactly what you can do to help.
Remember that you may need to use speech in specific ways to tell your loved one things. For example, upon leaving the room you may need to let them know you are going. Similarly, when greeting people, you may need to announce who someone is, as your loved one might not be able to recognize them. Also, remember that pointing, nodding the head, or using other body language will not be effective communication.
Although your loved one now has a vision impairment, it is very important to encourage self-reliance. By continuing to treat your loved one with respect and care, you can help him or her feel empowered to overcome challenges and remain as independent as possible.",vision-loss-blindness

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome/,Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,"Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is a combination of two neurological conditions often blended together. Wernicke’s encephalopathy is the initial, acute stage of the syndrome. If the individual recovers from the acute stage, Korsakoff amnesic syndrome, the chronic, long-term stage of WKS results.
While there are many symptoms, the most significant feature of the syndrome is its effect on memory. Specifically, the condition causes difficulty in creating new memories or retrieving recent memories (memories made prior to the illness often remain intact).
WKS is less common than other kinds of dementia. It affects 1 to 2 percent of the U.S. population, but the disease is likely underreported, especially the milder forms which are difficult to recognize. Slightly more men than women are diagnosed. And it most often affects people between the age of 30 and 70.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome/,Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,"A severe deficiency in vitamin B1, thiamine, is the cause of WKS. Thiamine is a vital nutrient that helps metabolize sugar, which produces energy for the brain. Lack of thiamine kills brain cells and therefore causes neurological changes and degrees of cognitive impairment.
WKS is typically associated with chronic alcoholism. Alcohol use inhibits thiamine absorption, and heavy drinkers can have poor dietary habits. Medical researchers are still examining the association between heavy alcohol use and symptoms of dementia. There may be a hereditary aspect to WKS, as well. But the most common presentation of WKS is a chronic alcoholic patient who is poorly nourished.
Malnutrition and other causes of nutritional deficiencies can cause or worsen WKS. These include eating disorders, cancer, chemotherapy, gastric bypass, and kidney dialysisall conditions that deplete thiamine from the body. Inability to afford proper food and medical care also contribute to WKS.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome/,Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,"Some symptoms that family members are more likely to take note of can be subtle. Watch for changes, especially these:
Lethargy
Drowsiness
Inattentiveness/indifference
Mental confusion
Vision problems
Muscle weakness
Muscle coordination issues, especially walking/gait
Tremor
Recent or short-term memory difficulties
Exaggerated storytelling
Agitation
Other, more acute symptoms that may indicate the need for more immediate medical attention include rapid heartbeat, low blood pressure, low body temperature, hallucinations, delirium, or stupor.
If you’ve seen any of the above signs or are concerned by other behavior, schedule an appointment with your family member’s primary care physician or, if needed, obtain immediate medical attention. And wherever the appointment takes place–in person, over the phone, or by video conference–be sure your family member has an advocate with them.
An advocate is someone who is there to support the patient, ask questions, and take notes of what is discussed. In this sort of situation, it will be impossible for a patient with serious memory problems to later share with family what happens during an appointment – so an advocate is vital.
Whether that advocate is you or another involved person, they should report back to family members about how the appointment went and communicate next steps – such as follow-up appointments, lab work, imaging tests, or home care advice.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome/,Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,"Physicians diagnose WKS after a thorough clinical examination, including lab work, imaging scans, and a detailed review of the patient’s health record. The work-up commonly covers the following:
A full medical history, including information about the person’s daily drinking habits—both past and present—and their dietary/nutritional history
A physical examination to check for signs of malnutrition.
Lab work that includes blood count, electrolytes, and liver function tests. Lab test results can reflect alcoholism-associated malnutrition or determine that the level of thiamine in the blood is below normal.
An MRI or CT scan that may show enlarged ventricles and diencephalic lesions, shrunken mammillary bodies, and other changes in the brain.
A referral by the psychiatrist or neurologist to a neuropsychologist is often necessary to quantify the degree of memory and other cognitive dysfunction and clarify the diagnosis.
Physicians should consult family, friends, and past medical records to get the most complete information possible on the person’s history with alcohol. ",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome/,Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,"These are the guidelines for diagnosing cases of alcohol-related dementia (not strictly WKS):
A “significant” alcohol history, which includes an average of 35 drinks per week for men (28 for women), typically for 5 to 10 years or more.
In order to obtain a reasonable diagnosis, 30 to 60 days should have transpired since the last exposure to alcohol. The longer without drinking and with good nutrition, the more accurate the diagnosis.
If physicians suspect non-alcohol related WKS, they may investigate other causes:
anorexia nervosa
hyperemesis gravidarum (an extreme form of morning sickness during pregnancy)
severe malnutrition
use of a feeding tube for an extended period of time without the addition of thiamine
other disorders or surgical procedures that impair intestinal absorption of thiamine
WKS can often be missed as a diagnosis. You may find it helpful to bring this fact sheet with you to the appointment to help in talking about your concerns with the physician.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome/,Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,"With a WKS diagnosis, treatment is critical and time sensitive.
If Wernicke’s encephalopathy is diagnosed and treated early, some or even all symptoms can be reversed. Once the chronic stage has set in recovery is less certain. Stopping alcohol use and ensuring a nutritious diet may prevent additional brain and nerve damage. Memory function, however, may be slow to improve; recovery is usually incomplete.
In the later stages, if damage to the brain is irreversible, individuals are likely to have lasting problems with memory and gait (for example, lack of muscle coordination and numbness or weakness in limbs).
Without treatment, according to the Alzheimer’s Association, the statistics can be discouraging:
Wernicke’s encephalopathy can be incapacitating and life-threatening. It causes death in up to 20 percent of patients.
In 85 percent of survivors, it progresses to Korsakoff syndrome.
If the patient continues to use alcohol and follow a poor diet the condition and symptoms will worsen.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome/,Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,"Treatment includes:
Thiamine replacement therapy administered as soon as possible.
Consistent, good hydration and nutrition.
Abstaining from alcohol—this is key.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome/,Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,"It is important to ensure that the affected person continues to abstain from drinking alcohol.
The person must maintain a nutritious, balanced diet and stay properly hydrated.
In the short term, it is critical that your family member have adequate, physician-recommended thiamine intake. In the long term, if your family member has a balanced diet and is well nourished, thiamine supplementation may not be necessary—check with your doctor.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome/,Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,"Even if the affected person stops drinking and replenishes thiamine, they may continue to show signs of the syndrome (e.g., confusion, lack of coordination, trouble with memory and recall). In a sober WKS patient, it’s important to recognize these symptoms as part of the disease caused by irreversible damage to the brain and nervous system.
Remember that in some sober WKS patients, those who do not know them might consider them unimpaired, as they can carry on an intelligent and entertaining discussion which belies their ability to carry on with life independently.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome/,Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,"Family caregivers should take precautions to ensure the safety of the person with WKS, as well as others in the household. 
The confused or disoriented individual should not be left alone. 
Supervision is required to ensure that the person does not wander away from home or leave the stove on or the water running.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome/,Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,"Short-term memory problems mean that the confused person may repeat the same question again and again. Coping with frequent repetition often involves a trial-and-error approach and a combination of strategies. 
Be patient and deliver responses in a calm manner. The confused person will pick up on your mood and may become more frustrated if your voice is loud or angry. 
Place reminders in the house to help the person feel more secure in their environment. Label inside doors and drawers with words or pictures of what’s inside. Write notes (e.g., dinner is at 6:00 pm). 
Distract the person with another topic or activity (e.g., a short walk, reminiscing over an old photo, etc.). 
If the person continues to be agitated, discuss the symptoms with a physician, neurologist, or psychiatrist. Medications may be available to help control outbursts or anxiety.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome/,Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,"Just as important, the caregiver needs support and time off from constant caregiving demands. Make sure you leave time to attend to your own.
Start with fundamental acts of self care, including eating well, getting enough sleep, and getting regular medical check-ups. 
Plan a schedule of periodic respites for yourself. You might need a home care worker, friend, or family member to help your loved one to provide you, the family caregiver, with a respite to relieve stress.",dementia

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome/,Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,"Strained relationships are common in families of alcoholics.
Individuals with a history of alcohol abuse have often isolated themselves from their families and loved ones. 
As a caregiver, you may feel resentful of caring for a parent or spouse with a life-long history of alcohol abuse. 
Most WKS-affected individuals have been long-term alcoholics, so It may be hard to convince your family member to give up drinking. Talk with a physician or mental health professional about effective strategies for prevention and management.
Research indicates that alcoholism often runs in families. This can put even more stress on family relationships.
Having additional family members who are alcoholic increases the burden of care. 
Research has shown that individuals may inherit a susceptibility to alcohol addiction and alcohol-related neurological problems (peripheral neuropathies). 
In alcoholic families, family members should take special precautions to avoid excessive use of alcohol to reduce their own risk of alcohol-related health problems.",dementia
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome/,Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome,"Mental health professionals and case workers experienced in addiction can offer much-needed help and support.
A case manager or counselor can help the family sort through issues and help arrange appropriate support services. 
Counselors and case workers can also help with family meetings and may be helpful in bringing together family members to assist the WKS person. They can also recommend support groups.
In severe cases, or when the family is unable to provide appropriate care, you may want to look into a residential facility. If a WKS patient experiences persistent confusion, there are nursing homes that provide special dementia care.",dementia

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/what-every-caregiver-needs-know-about-money/,What Every Caregiver Needs to Know About Money,"It sometimes seems that people are more comfortable talking about sex than money. Every family has unspoken rules and expectations about how they deal with money: how to save, how to spend, who has control, how decisions are made. When you become a caregiver for someone, money plays an important part in the choices you make about their care. And without question, money can be a huge source of friction within the family.
Many older people were raised during the Depression or had parents who shared a “Depression mentality.” Saving was important. Having money for a “rainy day” was essential. Not wasting was important. Anxiety about running out of money was an issue. A nest egg that allowed parents to leave an inheritance to their children was a matter of pride. And many adult children expect to receive an inheritance and want to maximize the amount they will receive.
Once a person needs a caregiver, money has to be discussed. Many older adults are reluctant to let their adult children know about their financial situation. It’s hard to admit that this is the “rainy day” they have been saving for all their lives. Understandably, they are extremely reluctant to give up control of their finances. However—and particularly when someone shows evidence of cognitive decline—a caregiver has to oversee the finances to prevent mistakes—bills not paid, or paid more than once, investments not looked after, irrational spending, or just losing money in the house or on the street. ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/what-every-caregiver-needs-know-about-money/,What Every Caregiver Needs to Know About Money,"Without a clear grasp of the financial situation of the person needing care, the caregiver will be hampered in his/her ability to make good long-term financial decisions. Starting the conversation can be the hardest part. Should you have the conversation one-on-one, or should it be a family meeting with siblings and other important people present? Maybe this conversation sounds familiar to you:
“Mom, we’re going to have to make some difficult decisions in the next few years. It would help if we could work together to understand the finances so we can make the best decisions for your care as your needs change.”
“Oh, dear, I don’t want to talk about that now. Things are fine and I’m handling all the bills without any problems.”
“I know things are good now, but what if you fell and broke your arm and couldn’t write a check? Then how would your bills get paid?”
This is a time to start the “what if” conversation. Suggest likely scenarios and ask “what would you want if …” and write down your parent’s responses. Some of these can be about health care wishes or living arrangements, and some of these will be about money. The better you understand how your loved one thinks about money, as well as what his/her concrete wishes are, the better you’ll be able to carry out those wishes and feel good honoring them to the best of your ability.
This leads to a conversation about other aspects of aging that involve money:
Is the home the best place for the care receiver to be?
Is it more expensive to pay for assisted living, or is it more expensive to hire a caregiver at home?
If I, as an adult child, provide the care, can I spend some of my parent’s money on hiring substitute or respite help so I can get a break from time to time?
Would it be better for my parents to pay me to be the caregiver, or is it better to hire from outside?
If we want to hire someone, should it be through an agency or should we hire privately?",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/what-every-caregiver-needs-know-about-money/,What Every Caregiver Needs to Know About Money,"As an adult child caring for an aging parent, you are probably torn in many directions. You have a job with responsibilities and expectations. You may have a spouse and children to provide for. And you need to take care of yourself. Taking care of yourself is supposed to include exercise, eating right, socializing with friends, and having down time. Somewhere in there you’re supposed to sleep. Now add caregiving to the mix and handling the finances for someone else. Balancing all of this becomes one more thing you have to do. It’s easy to become overwhelmed.
Many caregivers contemplate leaving their job so as to be more present and available to someone who now needs help on a daily basis. This is a complex decision to make, as it affects not only your finances (and your family’s), but also the finances of your parent and maybe even your siblings or other extended family members. (For more information on juggling caregiving and your job, see the FCA fact sheet Work and Eldercare.)
When you stop working, you immediately have to deal with changes in health insurance. Under COBRA you can pay privately for insurance for 18 months, or, under the current Affordable Care Act, you can buy health insurance on the open market (without penalty for pre-existing conditions). But this will cost money for you or for the family member you are responsible for.
Taking care of someone in the here and now is important, but planning for your own aging is also important. Not having a current income will compromise your income in the future. If you don’t pay into the Social Security system for a number of years, your income will be reduced when it comes time for you to collect your Social Security benefits. Pensions, retirement funds, IRAs, 401K employer matches, and other savings accounts can be similarly affected. Leaving a job may affect future job advancement, which will also effect later earnings. And work may also serve as your outlet, diversion, and social support.
One of the most frequent questions asked at Family Caregiver Alliance is, “How can I be paid to be a caregiver to my parent?” If you are going to be the primary caregiver, is there a way that your parent or the care receiver can pay you for the help you provide? The short answer is yes, as long as all parties agree. (To learn how to set up a formal arrangement for payment, see the FCA fact sheet Personal Care Agreements.) If the care receiver is eligible for Medicaid (MediCal in California), it might be possible for you to be paid through In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS).",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/what-every-caregiver-needs-know-about-money/,What Every Caregiver Needs to Know About Money,"Questions to ask yourself and other family members:
How will my rent/mortgage be paid if I move in with Mom or Dad?
Are family members okay with having Mom/Dad reimburse me for the added expenses I will accrue in taking care of them? These might include living expenses, medical expenses, transportation, and food.
If I am providing the primary care, will you (other family members) be able to help, or will I be expected to do it all? How can we divide up the responsibilities? If I am getting paid, should you get paid for the things you do?
How will we, as a family, make decisions about Mom’s/Dad’s care? How do we decide how their money will be spent? Who will be in control of the finances?
Where will I go for support? Will my friends or family help me get breaks? What hobbies or other things do I have that will engage me in my down time as a caregiver? How will I have the spending money to be able to go out with friends or buy things I want?
If I am the primary caregiver, are you okay with my spending Mom’s/Dad’s money to help care for me, too? This will mean there might be less available in the inheritance. Should I get a different percentage of the inheritance if I have done all the work? If I don’t quit my job and do this, are you okay with hiring help to care for Mom/Dad? This, too, will effect your inheritance.
If Mom or Dad needs to move into an assisted living community or nursing home, how will we make that decision, and how much will finances play a part in the decision-making?
If Mom or Dad does run out of money, can any of us help pay their living expenses?
What do we need to know about Medicaid and Medicare coverage to make good decisions about paying for care in the future?",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/what-every-caregiver-needs-know-about-money/,What Every Caregiver Needs to Know About Money,"We all have emotional triggers when we talk about money. Is money equivalent to love? Does someone get more money because of need or because he or she is the “favorite”? Have the parents provided support for one sibling all these years? What will happen to him or her when parents are no longer able to help?
If a parent won’t let the family caregivers oversee finances, there can be feelings of not being trusted or being treated like a child. Should an inheritance be divided equally or given to whoever needs it most, or to whoever did the most work? If there is not a lot of money, there can be feelings of anger and resentment over the feeling that the parents put the adult children in a difficult situation. If there is a lot of money, greed can become a motivating factor in making decisions.
Often families divide up who is handling the money and who is doing the caregiving. This puts the caregiver in the position of having to ask for money, and the person handling the money has control over how money is spent. This can lead to tension and family estrangement. (See FCA fact sheet Caregiving with Your Siblings.)",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/what-every-caregiver-needs-know-about-money/,What Every Caregiver Needs to Know About Money,"“If only my parents had been more frugal.”
“I have always been the responsible one, and now you’re getting the same amount of the inheritance as I am.”
“Dad was so irresponsible, he didn’t plan for old age or illness and now I have to figure everything out.”
“How do I respect Mom’s wish not to be in a nursing home when she has no money to hire extra help at home?”
“If I move Dad in with us, can we charge rent to offset the added expenses? How will my siblings feel if we do this?”
“How can I get Mom to spend her money on her care now, rather than thinking she needs to keep saving it for the future?”
“Shouldn’t my wealthy sister pay more for Mom’s care than I do, since I don’t have as much?”
“Can Mom and Dad gift us money now so they will qualify for a nursing home under Medicaid later? Can I trust you to not spend the money so it will be there if Mom and Dad need it in the future?”
“Will you send us all the bank statements since you are overseeing their finances? We want to know where their money is going.”
“I need a break from caregiving. Will you use some of their money to pay for someone to look after Mom for a weekend so I can get away?”
“We are paying for a caregiver to be with Dad three days a week. Will you do a shift on one of the other days? If not, will you pay more to cover the caregiver’s costs?”
“Mom had an investment worth $100,000. What happened to it?”",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/what-every-caregiver-needs-know-about-money/,What Every Caregiver Needs to Know About Money,"If the care receiver does not have dementia, he or she has the right to make decisions, including bad decisions. This means he/she can make seemingly irrational decisions about money and how to spend it or not spend it. This is very hard for caregivers to accept—we want to help do things “right” and make logical decisions. Also, we worry that we will have to pick up the pieces and solve problems that arise if money is not handled judiciously. Each family struggles with this in their own way. Bringing in an outside person, such as a minister, attorney, social worker, or physician might help.
Whether someone has dementia or not, elders can be subject to “undue influence.” People who befriend them may find a way into their hearts—and pocketbooks—in ways that can lead to the older person being “overly generous” with his or her funds. Keeping an eye on the finances can help you catch any extraordinary outflows of money.
If Mom or Dad does have dementia from a disorder such as Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, or another condition, they need more oversight to make sure the finances are handled appropriately. Help is needed now, because making logical, rational, and reasonable decisions might not be possible later. And since dementia gets worse with time, processes need to be put in place as soon as possible, so that someone can handle the finances down the road. It is easier to do this while the care receiver is still able to understand and sign the necessary documents to give the caregiver or a fiduciary the necessary powers. If it is not done in a timely manner, it may be necessary to apply for a conservatorship, which is expensive, emotionally wrenching, and time-consuming. (See the FCA fact sheets Guardianships and Conservatorships and Legal Planning for Incapacity.)
If legal planning has not been done, start with an estate planning or “elder law” attorney who can help with writing a will or trust, and also complete Power of Attorney for Finances, which can be activated when the time is right. (See the FCA fact sheet Finding an Attorney to Help with Estate Planning.)",[]

It is challenging to deal with the complexity of our emotions about parents, illness, aging, and death, and sometimes these emotions come out in conflicts about money. Holding a family meeting with a facilitator might help the family come together rather than be torn apart by these issues (See the FCA fact sheet Holding a Family Meeting.)",[]

And when the what-ifs apply to you, they can produce even more anxiety. Wondering what will happen to your caregiving duties if you get Covid, if you have a fall, if you’re in a car accident – all of those are normal concerns to cross your mind. If you’re not careful, you could easily fall into a worry loop – an endless cascade of increasingly stressful questions asking, “what would happen if …?”",[]

Step 1: Pause. Be aware of when you feel yourself growing anxious.
Step 2: Breathe slowly. Or try a grounding exercise – name the objects in the room you’re in or count backward from 100 by sevens. The point of the activity is to lead you to a reasonable and functional level of calm so you can move to the next step.
Step 3: Plan.
The truth is that many scenarios could compromise your ability to care for your friend or family member. That’s part of life. The important thing is to move from feelings of anxiety to a place where you can take action – do something to help improve the situation. Proactively considering possible scenarios means you can thoughtfully and effectively create backup and emergency plans.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/what-if-something-happens-to-me/,What if Something Happens to Me?,"Your most important question is who your backup would be if you could not take care of your friend or family member.
Whether your needs might be short- or long-term, start with who may be available and open to helping: An adult child, an extended family member, a neighbor, a good friend? Think about your network and who would be the most likely person to come through to help you if you needed it. Talk with them about what you might need and their willingness to step in and lend a hand. Sometimes, this might be professional caregiving help hired from an agency or service.
Planning for all what-if scenarios begins with finding the right person to back you up. You may find several people, or a mix of friends, family, and professional caregivers: a more realistic approach than relying on a single individual.",[]

Steps you take now – from online, phone, and in-person research to booking contingency arrangements – will help everyone should the need arise in the future for substitute/temporary caregiving help.
Contact local home care agencies and see their process for hiring in-home care. Find out if they have attendants available on an emergency basis or if you must be registered with them in advance. If possible, do a test run – try using their services a few times (perhaps as respite care during time off for you).
If your friend or family member qualifies for Medicaid, apply now. This can provide a payment source should they need placement in a long-term care facility.
Contact your Area Agency on Aging (http://eldercare.acl.gov) to see what resources they have for emergency care. Tell them you are a caregiver and are preparing for the unexpected. Ask if they recommend reaching out to Adult Protective Services when the primary caregiver is not available, to let them know that your friend or loved one is alone and needs help. APS may be able to look in on them and see if there are resources that can help with their care.
Let trusted people know there is a vulnerable person in the home. Reach out to a neighbor, landlord, or local fire department, and introduce yourself as your friend or family member’s caregiver. Ask them to look in during an emergency or natural disaster.
It’s important you provide someone trustworthy with a spare key so they may check in during such a scenario. In addition to giving a spare key to your back-up person, you may want to have another one hidden outside, where a neighbor or others know where it is.
Consider hiring a geriatric care manager who will work with you on an ongoing basis to ensure everything is in place. You can find care managers through the National Association for Aging Life Care Managers (www.aginglifecare.org).
Make sure your friend or family member knows when and how to call 911 (if they have dementia, this does not apply). Or pre-program a speed-dial button for emergency response and be sure they know how to use it if needed.
Get a Medical Alert ID bracelet for yourself so that emergency response professionals will know when tending to you that there is an impaired person at home and can check on them. You can get a bracelet that says, “I am a caregiver” and allows you to put contact information on the back. (Available through the Alzheimer’s Association, www.alz.org, the ID Band, www.theidbandco.com, or Medic Alert, www.medicalert.org/bracelets).
Have legal papers in order and easy to find – your own as well as those of your friend or family member. You may want to note the location of these important documents in your emergency binder, adding a note on the refrigerator for EMS personnel that access to legal paperwork is explained in the binder.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/what-if-something-happens-to-me/,What if Something Happens to Me?,"Before there is a need, research home care agencies in your area and register with them. That way, when/if you need someone to come into the house to help, you can call and start the service without completing the intake process before services begin.
Conversely, you might network with friends for private caregivers you can call on. Often private caregivers will put up a notice at the local senior center, and you can interview and check them out ahead of time. See links to FCA resources to help with the process of hiring help.
The same is true for assisted living facilities. If you break a hip or need a knee replacement, you might be unable to provide care for several weeks. In this scenario, a good choice may be a respite room in a nearby retirement community or Board and Care. Doing your research ahead of time and knowing what is available and what is required takes the burden off you to figure out your options while dealing with many other decisions.
It’s important to note that most live-in facilities require an up-to-date TB test for someone to move in. You can talk with your friend or family member’s physician to ensure this is done every six months to assure there is current proof of the test and results on file.",[]

Paratransit can help transport you and your friend or family member to doctors’ appointments and necessary errands.

These are valuable for the person you care for, but you should also consider whether you need one for yourself. As a caregiver, if you fell or were in another type of distress, such a device would allow you to call for help as well as request support for your friend or family member.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/when-caregiving-ends/,When Caregiving Ends,"Caregiving can last for many years. Caregivers set their own lives aside to care for someone else. When that person dies, caregivers have to figure out what to do with their lives now. There is no preparation for this transition. Generally you are so busy caregiving, and life changed so long ago, that there has not been time nor energy or even the psychological will to think about what comes next. Here are some tips that might help you during this time:",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/when-caregiving-ends/,When Caregiving Ends,"Grief — It is normal to feel sad, angry, hopeless, bereft, devastated. Our society says you should get over it in a week or two. Actually, it often takes one to two years. Allow yourself these feelings. They are normal and appropriate. (See FCA Fact Sheet Grief and Loss).
Relief — Many caregivers feel relieved that their ordeal is over and that the care receiver is no longer suffering. This is not something to feel guilty about. It is one of many feelings that people have when caregiving ends. Grieving may have started many years before with a gradual letting go process, particularly with dementia.
Forgive Yourself — Caregivers often feel guilty about every time they were not the perfect caregiver. There is no such thing. Everyone was impatient, angry, frustrated, unkind at some point during their time as a caregiver. It’s OK. Don’t second guess yourself with “what ifs.” You probably couldn’t have done anything else, even though you are thinking you could have. Celebrate how  well you did this job!
Sleep — Often, one of the first feelings caregivers have is exhaustion. Now is the time to sleep. You need to renew your energy. Sometimes you need to stay in bed for a day and cry or just pull the covers up and watch TV. You deserve to take a break. You might enjoy the quiet, the doing nothing.
Confusion — Caregivers have put their lives on hold in order to be a caregiver. Now you are out of the job that you held for the past several years and you might have to redefine your purpose. It’s normal to feel adrift as you try to find your place in the world and figure out who you are now.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/when-caregiving-ends/,When Caregiving Ends,"Time — What to do with it? Time was structured for you while you were caregiving. Now you have to figure out what to do each day. You learned good time management skills while you were a caregiver. Use these skills now for you to achieve new goals. Celebrate having time to reflect and make new decisions. Thinking about the future can be scary. Take one day at a time.
Loneliness — There can be an emptiness/void that comes from not being needed in the same way anymore. Since caregiving is so all consuming, caregivers often end up isolated. When caregiving ends, you often have to re-build a social network. Make social engagements when you feel you want to but also allow others who invite you to do things back into your life by saying yes.
Activities — Take small steps in re-entering into life again. Identify activities or hobbies that you enjoy and energize you. Volunteer—many caregivers find their skills can be used to help others. Exercise. It may have been a long time since you were able to focus on your needs. Your body now needs attention. Your mind also needs exercise. Take a class, read a book or even the newspaper
Take care of YOU — Exercise, get enough sleep and eat right. The three things we all have to do. But now you can. You had to be strong for someone else, now you can be strong for you. But you can also now let down and express your vulnerability. You have the right to the full range of emotions, now you can feel them. Caregivers’ financial situation often changes when caregiving ends. Make sure to pay attention to finances, whether your situation is better or worse than before. Get help if you need it. Seek counseling if you need support or to just talk through all that you have been through and continue to go through.
Embrace Life Now — Appreciate the skills you learned while caregiving and find a way to use them. You did things you never thought you could—appreciate your strength. Create a new focus for your life. Maybe find a new job or a new interest. It’s OK to enjoy life again, to laugh and play. It’s not being disloyal to your loved one. Realize that you have to invent a “new normal” from what you’ve been doing. Make your home your own again. Depending on your situation, you might want to start dating or looking for romantic relationships. Take it slow. It’s ok to get guidance from friends and professionals to help you navigate this new world.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/work-and-eldercare/,Work and Eldercare,"More than ever before, caregiving is a significant part of everyday life for millions of families throughout the United States. As our population ages, more families are providing care for an older adult at home, and an increasing number of people will need such care in the future. Current demographic and healthcare trends make this issue even more significant.
The massive Baby Boomer generation is at prime caregiving age, and soon many will become care recipients themselves.
Although we are living longer, debilitating, age-related illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, Parkinson’s disease, arthritis, diabetes, and stroke are occurring with increasing frequency.
Hospital stays are becoming shorter, meaning more care is needed at home.
Women, who have traditionally been the caregivers for both children and the elderly, are now in the workforce and less available to provide full-time care.
More men are assuming caregiving responsibilities.
Caregiving impacts not only a growing number of individuals, but their families and their workplaces as well. According to recent studies, 60% of caregivers were employed in the last year and over half of these work full time. The average age of caregivers is 49—a peak year for earnings and for career achievement. Women take on slightly more responsibility for care, but men are also greatly impacted.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/work-and-eldercare/,Work and Eldercare,"The types of care ranges from personal (bathing, dressing, helping with toileting, feeding) to everyday tasks and activities (preparing meals, providing transportation, handling finances, managing medications, coordinating services, communicating with healthcare professionals). The average caregiver provides care for more than four years, with some care extending for decades. Few caregivers use paid help: fully 76 percent of working caregivers rely only on their families and themselves. At times, caregiving can seem like a second job with the average caregiver providing more than 24 hours of care a week and many providing much more care than that.
Thus, millions of working adults—this year it is estimated one in three households—will be juggling the competing demands of caring for a chronically ill relative, raising a family, and managing a career. Work disruptions due to employee caregiving responsibilities result in productivity losses to businesses of an estimated $2110 per year per employee—a loss of up to $33.6 billion per year for full-time employees as a group.
Negative effects on working caregivers may include poorer health, time lost from work and lower productivity, leaving a job to give care, lost career opportunities, lost employer paid health benefits, and lower current and future earnings, including Social Security and pension income. Eventually 10 percent of these working caregivers, over the time they are caregiving, report quitting their jobs to provide care full time, resulting in an average loss of more than $303,880 each in wages, Social Security income, and pension income over a lifetime.
This fact sheet reviews the key issues that caregivers face; suggests measures they can take to help manage their work and care conflicts; reviews legal options to clarify financial and healthcare decision making; and discusses cost-efficient ways employers can retain valued employees by offering programs that are supportive to caregivers. The resources listed at the end of the fact sheet offer additional information, sources of help, and suggested reading ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/work-and-eldercare/,Work and Eldercare,"Many community resources exist to help caregivers and their ill or frail relative or friend. Your challenge as a caregiver is to determine how to best utilize the time and energy you have available for caregiving in addition to the demands of your job and family responsibilities.
Taking a team approach is an important step to make your role as a caregiver more manageable and to ensure that your loved one gets the best care possible. When you provide the care for your loved one that focuses in on the aspects of care that are most important to you and that you are best suited to your strengths and skills this sets you up to provide the best care you can, draw boundaries that help you to care for yourself, and enjoy your role as a caregiver. Likewise, when you utilize the support of others that are also using their strengths and skills to provide care for your loved one, it gives your loved one the opportunity to receive the best care and to see that they can get their needs met by others besides you. In sorting out your family’s needs, and deciding where you need help, consider the following steps:
Make a list of all you do as a caregiver. For example, I do the grocery shopping; help Mom dress every morning; take Dad to the doctor; pay his bills; do her laundry.
Make a second list of where you see gaps in their needs and care.
Then circle items that you might be able to delegate to others and the times you need help. For example, keep Mom company and prepare her lunch while I’m at work, or give Dad a ride to the senior center on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 9:00 a.m.
Consider what type of care is needed (companion, chore work, food preparation, nursing) and whether the care can be delivered at home, a senior center, an adult day care center, or another location.
Hold a family meeting to include as many primary stakeholders in your loved one’s care as possible. It is important to get the input of the care receiver as well, if possible. Discuss what role each is playing in care now and how changes might be made to increasingly help with gaps. This can be an important time to discuss more complicated medical and legal issues. This should be done in an open, supportive environment where family members can identify potential solutions together. The meeting can be held in-person, by phone, or by video conference.
To work through certain family dynamics or conflicts, it’s often helpful to involve a person outside the family. A social worker, geriatric care manager, life coach or other professional skilled in group interaction and family dynamics can be hired to help the family and caregiver make a care plan and, if needed, help with care arrangements and monitoring. (See fact-sheet: Holding a Family Meeting for more information.
Determine how much money your loved one or your family can afford to pay for outside help. Generally, long-term care is not covered by health insurance unless you have purchased a long-term care policy. Even then, there may be limitations on what kinds of home care are covered. Medicare pays only for medically necessary care or equipment. If you meet the income qualifications, Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California) may pay for some services.
Explore care options in your community or near your loved one’s home. Ask friends and neighbors about their experiences with local services they have used and care providers for hire.",[]

If no medical or personal care is needed, look for a caring, responsible person who could be a welcome companion for your relative. Personal referrals are the best way to find this person, or an ad can be placed online or in a local newspaper to search for a part-time companion and chore worker. If care involves toileting or bathing, you will need a person who is trained, competent, and sensitive. Similarly, if lifting the person and/or a wheelchair is necessary, be sure the worker is trained and physically able do the work. Always do criminal background checks, call at least three past employer references, call your homeowners/apartment insurance policy to ensure that they will be covered, and be aware that you will serve as their employer with the responsibilities this entails.
When medical or health care is required, such as giving medications, providing catheter care, or monitoring a feeding tube, you may decide to hire a certified nursing assistant (CNA) or licensed practical nurse (LPN or LVN in California) depending on the level of education and skill required. A registered nurse (RN) is needed only when more complex medical care is necessary (such as treating wounds, or managing a ventilator). Medicare may cover medically necessary part-time care for a home-bound older person in limited, specific situations.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/work-and-eldercare/,Work and Eldercare,"Adult day care centers provide a range of social and therapeutic activities outside the home for older adults and adults with a disability. These centers, located primarily in urban areas, vary in their service mix. Most offer social services and activities in a safe, supportive environment. Depending on the program, some offer transportation, personal health care (such as bathing and incontinence care), and medical or allied health care (such as physical therapy and occupational therapy), may be available. It is important to check eligibility criteria. Some centers may not accept individuals who are disruptive, have certain health problems, or are incontinent (loss of bladder/bowel control). Participants generally attend several hours per day, up to five days a week (weekend adult day care is rarely available), making it possible for the caregiver to go to work assured that the care recipient is in a safe place.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/work-and-eldercare/,Work and Eldercare,"In California, eleven Caregiver Resource Centers (CRCs) provide a range of supportive services to family caregivers of adults with disabling health conditions (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson’s disease). CRCs help caregivers with information, educational programs, and emotional support, as well as planning for and arranging services for a loved one. Most services are free of charge. More information can be found by visiting FCA’s list of California’s Caregiver Resource Centers.
Many other community services are available to help, including care management services, home-delivered meals, transportation services, temporary overnight care, and support groups (for either the caregiver or the ill individual). Your local Area Agency on Aging or senior center can help you locate these.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/work-and-eldercare/,Work and Eldercare,"When a parent or relative can no longer be cared for at home, it may be necessary to consider a residential facility such as an assistive living residence or nursing home. Arriving at this decision can be quite painful. Both you and loved one are likely to have strong feelings about nursing homes, and financing is always an issue. You may want to discuss the decision with other family members, a counselor, life coach, or spiritual advisor.
Ultimately, it is important to evaluate your loved one’s current living situation and carefully assess how care needs can best be met. Consider your relative’s safety, isolation, ability to be left alone, medical needs, and available help for basic daily activities (e.g., eating, dressing, toileting, bathing, moving around).
In addition, the daily strain on you as the caregiver must not be ignored. If you, your sibling, or parent are the primary caregiver, it is critical to recognize when caregiving demands—especially when combined with work and other family demands—exceed what is possible for you, your family, and friends. If you determine that home is no longer a good or safe place to be, it is time to look at other viable residential care options:
Senior residences or Assisted Living Facilities (ALF) offer maximum independence, apartment-style living, and additional services such as meals, house cleaning, transportation, recreation and social activities and, sometimes, an on-call nurse. Depending on the state, ALFs may or may not be licensed to accept Medicaid reimbursement. VA benefits and long-term care insurance benefits cover these costs in some cases
Residential Care Facilities (also called board and care homes or adult foster homes) are group homes for individuals who cannot live alone but do not need skilled nursing. These facilities offer help with personal care and hygiene, meals, social interaction with others, and bedside care. They have 24-hour staff in case of emergencies. Depending on the state, this type of residence may or may not be licensed and may or may not accept Medicaid reimbursement. VA or long-term care insurance may also cover the costs.
Memory Care Facilities offer care for those with cognitive impairments such as Alzheimer’s disease or similar conditions. This may be its own residence or part of an assisted living or nursing care facility. Facility staff must be trained to handle specific needs and behaviors related to having dementia, and the facility must have locked or delayed exit style doors, an alert system, or an auditory device to monitor exits. Depending on the state, Medicaid may cover the costs of care, or they may be covered by VA or long-term care insurance benefits.
Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF) provide nursing care to residents and must be equipped to administer medications and injections and to provide other nursing functions. Under certain limited conditions, Medicare may pay some nursing home costs, but for a limited time only. Medicaid, VA benefits, and long-term care insurance benefits can be options for covering care long term.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/work-and-eldercare/,Work and Eldercare,"If your relative becomes impaired, you may face a host of new legal and financial issues. Typical concerns include:
Who will manage the ill person’s money
Who will make important health care decisions
How to plan for long-term care
An attorney can help you plan for the financial aspects of your relative’s care needs. At a minimum, a suitable attorney should have experience in estate and financial planning, probate and wills, and be familiar with public benefits including Medicaid, Social Security, special needs trusts, tax planning, and housing and health care contracts. Some ways to locate an attorney include: your local County Bar Association or the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys referral service, senior centers, legal aid organizations, or a personal recommendation from a friend or fellow support group member.
Making decisions for a person with an illness such as Alzheimer’s disease or a stroke can be difficult and emotionally charged. The process can be simplified significantly, however, if your parent or relative has completed a Durable Power of Attorney (DPA) and a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care and Advance Health Care Directive. In some cases a Durable Mental Health Power of Attorney is needed for some kinds of treatment. These documents enable your parent to designate another person to manage his or her finances and healthcare decisions. The legal authority to make those decisions begins only when and if the person becomes incapable of doing so on their own. It’s a good idea to have DPA and DPAHC forms reviewed by an attorney experienced in estate planning to ensure that the person’s wishes are clearly expressed and the information is complete.
If your loved one is already suffering from dementia and does not have the capacity to make decisions, you may need to obtain a conservatorship. A conservatorship provides the legal authority to manage a person’s finances, estate, personal affairs, assets, and medical care. This is a court procedure. ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/work-and-eldercare/,Work and Eldercare,"In addition to providing access to a wealth of medical and caregiving information available 24 hours a day on your computer, tablet, or cell phone, digital technology may also be useful for such things as ordering prescriptions, medical supplies or groceries; communicating with healthcare professionals; staying in contact with friends and family; scheduling home car; learning new skills through webinars; tracking movement; and even visually checking on your relative or friend during the day or providing surveillance of your loved one’s home when you can’t be there.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/work-and-eldercare/,Work and Eldercare,"Caregiving as a workplace issue is now recognized by a growing number of employers.

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/work-and-eldercare/,Work and Eldercare,"The most requested work adjustment is flexibility in work hours. This may include allowing a shift in schedules (e.g., working 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. instead of 9 to 5; a compressed work schedule (four ten-hour days instead of five eight-hour days); a part-time schedule; job sharing; or telecommuting. A limit on mandatory overtime is also helpful. Studies have shown that flexible scheduling improves job performance, decreases tardiness and employee turnover, and increases job satisfaction and retention (even for employees who are not currently caregivers).",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/work-and-eldercare/,Work and Eldercare,"Human Resources or Employee Assistance Program staff can provide information on helpful Internet sites, local community services, care managers or resource centers, and should provide information about leave programs and other company policies.
Training for supervisors enhances understanding of the conflicting demands of work and caregiving and ensures that mandates for family leave and antidiscrimination regulations are met.
Various state regulations and certain sections of the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) prohibit employers from discriminating against caregiving employees (for example, passing over employees for promotion, stereotyping employees because of caregiving status).
Some larger employers offer “cafeteria-style” employee benefits, which allow employees to select supplemental dependent care coverage to partially reimburse costs for in-home care or adult day care. A few companies offer subsidized payments for geriatric care managers.
Sometimes larger businesses organize in-house caregiver support groups, informational “brown-bag” lunch sessions, or coordinate with local community groups or hospitals so that employees can attend an outside support group.
Some employers arrange group purchase of long-term care insurance for employees, spouses, and dependents.
Other supportive, low-cost things employers can do include publicizing a telephone hotline for caregivers, and publishing a list of key contacts or advice in the employee newsletter.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/work-and-eldercare/,Work and Eldercare,"Companies with 50 or more employees must comply with the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave (or 26 weeks to care for an active service member). The leave may be used to care for a seriously ill parent, spouse, or child. Job and health insurance are protected. However, approximately half of US companies have fewer than 50 employees and therefore are exempt from FMLA requirements. Nonetheless, many use FMLA guidelines to provide support for individual employees.
Paid Family Leave (PFL) is a mandated benefit that covers caregivers of a seriously ill parent, child, spouse, or registered domestic partner, as well as new parents. California and only a handful of other states currently offer paid family leave. In California, employees may receive up to 55% of their wages for six weeks of leave. Job security is not protected. Workers who already pay in to the existing State Disability Insurance (SDI) system (you will see it as a deduction on your paycheck) are eligible for paid family leave.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/work-and-eldercare/,Work and Eldercare,"Caring for an ill or disabled loved one can be particularly challenging as you attempt to balance the competing demands of work, family, and caregiving. Negotiating adequate time off from work, coping with tension-filled family dynamics, and having time to cope with your own fears and concerns about your relative’s well-being all contribute to increased stress. Taking care of yourself will help ensure that you are physically and emotionally able to care for your family member. To help care for you, consider the following steps:
Be Informed: Obtain up-to-date information. For example, Family Caregiver Alliance has a variety of fact sheets and other materials (see the Resources section below) to help you make informed decisions. A wealth of caregiver information is available online.
Ask for Help: Say ‘yes’ when people offer assistance. Don’t try to do everything yourself—a sibling, relative, or friend may be able to assist. Some organizations offer specialized care planning guidance to help you get through the “maze” of long-term care options.
Pay Attention to How You Are Feeling: Let yourself feel the sadness, uncertainty, grief, and other emotions that come with caregiving. If you’re feeling highly stressed, consider drawing on the help of a support group, professional therapist, or life coach.
Attend to Your Body’s Needs: Exercise is a great stress-reducer. Although your time is limited, try to fit in some physical exercise, even if it’s just a quick walk around the block. In addition, eating regular meals with healthy foods, getting adequate sleep, and seeing the doctor regularly are an important part of supporting your immune system and caring for your overall health.
Draw on the Support of Others: Surround yourself with people that encourage and energize you in your caregiving journey. Make it a priority to take time to talk to and get together with those support people in your life.
Be as Patient and Flexible As You Can: There will be good days and bad days. Learn how to communicate effectively with your loved one without laying blame. Let go of things that don’t have to be done. Understand that it will take some time to arrange services that address your loved one’s needs, and those needs will most likely change over time.
Know Your Limits: Give yourself a break. Remember to schedule some time to relax. “Respite care” is designed to allow a break for the caregiver, and can last an hour, a day, or even a week. A few organizations even offer weekend retreats for caregivers or ill or elderly family members. Check your local resources for helpful programs.
Whether you are caring for a loved one out of love and devotion, or simply being responsible by honoring a familial obligation, assuming the role of caregiver is never easy. Your decision to care may occur all of a sudden when you receive an emergency call from the hospital, or it may be planned, having over time prepared for your relative to live with or near you. In either case saying, “Of course I’ll help and take care of you” is often the best response to a situation when your loved one needs help. Family-friendly workplace policies can go a long way towards making your caregiving journey less stressful and more manageable.",[]

https://www.caregiver.org/resource/working-successfully-home-care-services/,Working Successfully with Home Care Services,"You are the caregiver who has finally conceded that “outside” help is needed and you’ve taken the plunge. You’ve done your homework (or not) and hired home care workers. You’ve already sorted out whether to use an agency or to hire private contractors. You may have made your decisions with reams of information or with little information at all. Paid caregivers are now in place to help care for your loved one.
Yet, the situation still does not feel under control, and you feel stressed. Your loved one might even be delighted with the caregiver, but you’re not happy about some aspects of home care. What next? Whether the care receiver lives with you or alone or with other family, you may find that several more hats have been added to the ones you’ve already been wearing. On top of being a spouse, an adult child, and a loving caregiver, perhaps you now feel you need nurse’s aide skills with a smattering of R.N. and M.D. skills; accounting skills with knowledge of employer responsibilities; and supervisory skills covering personal care, household care, and the special needs of people with dementia. And you’re asking: “Isn’t this why I hired help?”",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/working-successfully-home-care-services/,Working Successfully with Home Care Services,"There are many possible sources of stress in utilizing home care services. Family members might provide help in various ways, but some might have no role where home care is concerned. Family members who live with the care receiver probably have a role in home care, but how they relate to paid caregivers may be uncertain. If there’s an agency involved, does the agency have a role other than providing a worker? If there’s a professional care manager, what is that person’s role? Once you determine who is on the team, then you might ask, “who wears which hats?” Maybe the team does not expect you to do anything other than hire the home care worker. Or, maybe the team expects you to do everything. Sorting these issues out early in the home care venture (or adventure) can make the plan work more smoothly.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/working-successfully-home-care-services/,Working Successfully with Home Care Services,"A second source of stress may arise when a care plan is too vague. In the “care management” model, the care manager follows a process which includes assessment, planning, implementation, and evaluation. If you have already hired home care workers, knowingly or unknowingly you’ve completed the first three steps. It’s expected, and more than okay, to evaluate your plan as often as needed. Assessing, planning, implementing, and evaluating are a continual process. Care plans need to change from time to time. They also need flexibility. Both the care receivers and the caregivers (paid or family) will have some variation in their abilities and needs from day to day.
A care plan is a written plan that outlines the paid caregiver’s duties. A written schedule is useful as well. If there is more than one caregiver, it might even be essential in order to assure that all tasks are covered.
A written care plan is particularly helpful if last minute substitute care is needed, so everyone knows the plan for the day. Because consistency in routines is useful when working with someone with dementia, the care plan is a way to provide details of those routines. The plan may even provide hints on what strategy works in getting the care recipient to cooperate with bathing or other activities.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/working-successfully-home-care-services/,Working Successfully with Home Care Services,"A third to way to minimize stress in home care involves communication. A notebook in the care receiver’s home is essential if the care receiver has dementia. The caregivers can communicate with each other or with you about how the plan is working. Some paid caregivers will bring new and useful ideas to you on how to care for your loved one. Some will think that they know more than they do. Read carefully. The comments of some paid caregivers may reveal that they need more training or are not suitable at all.
The notebook is also a way to track variations in the schedule: “John was pacing all day and refused to shower.” “Ann asked for a shower today.” In addition to getting a sense of how your loved one is functioning, you will also get a sense about whether certain workers have more difficulty getting your loved one to cooperate (and whether, in general, they are skilled in taking care of someone with dementia).
The notebook will also provide you with other useful information about your loved one. When care receivers are unable to report reliably about essential bodily functions, the communication book is useful way to note whether the care receiver eats and drinks enough; whether he or she has adequate elimination; whether there are any new concerns about mobility; whether there are any skin problems; and the like.
However, the communication notebook does not replace the need to check in personally with the home care worker. ",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/working-successfully-home-care-services/,Working Successfully with Home Care Services,"Some of your stress may be related to having set up no plan for supervision or checking in. It may be difficult to start this practice after a problem arises. Both you and the home care worker will probably benefit from regularly scheduled meetings or telephone conversations. The communication notebook will not cover it all.
If you’ve been lucky, you’ve hired someone who stepped right in and took over without a problem. A really good home care worker will even have skills to take care of you as well as your loved one. Be prepared for the possibility of wearing the “being taken care of” hat. If your loved one lives with you, your paid caregiver may want to cook for you or clean for you. You will need to decide what you are comfortable with. The home care worker may be sympathetic about how difficult it was for you to be up all night with the care receiver. This same home care worker will want to hear positive feedback from you about the care that she is providing. This home care worker may even want to coach you about how to provide care. Yet, if some part of her care provision is a problem, this same experienced home care worker must get that message as well.
Thus, it is useful, early on in the home care venture, to set up a plan for checking in with the worker regularly, either face to face or on the telephone. It is useful to create a safe space where the home care worker can share her expertise with you and where you can share your preferences for care for yourself and your loved one.
It is also essential to sometimes be at the care receiver’s home to do “odd jobs” while the paid caregiver is there. While you are occupied with the “odd jobs,” you will have an opportunity to see and hear how the caregiver interacts with your loved one. If your loved one is responsive and involved when this caregiver is around, you may be able to overlook the fact that this caregiver is not neat about making a bed. If you know that your loved one argues with you every time you try to give a shower and you see that the caregiver has a way to gain cooperation, then you are reassured that you have hired well. On the other hand, you may overhear another paid caregiver arguing with your loved one about resistance to taking a shower. Then you must decide if that worker needs further training or has crossed a line into unacceptable behavior. In all likelihood, your loved one with dementia cannot give you reliable feedback about each paid caregiver.
You protest, “I am not a manager or a supervisor.” If you feel you truly are not a good supervisor, can anyone else on the team do this job? If you have hired through an agency, clarify whether the agency supervises its employees on a regular basis at the care recipient’s home. Determine whether the agency supervisor has the skills to supervise your loved one’s care. Is the plan for supervision detailed in the agency’s contract? If you have hired a private contractor or have hired through an agency that does not provide regular supervision, would a private care manager be useful and affordable for you? It is guaranteed that the home care plan will not run itself. If you are not a supervisor, then you’ll probably end up as chairman of the board. You won’t escape involvement unless the rest of the team bails you out somehow.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/working-successfully-home-care-services/,Working Successfully with Home Care Services,"Many aspects of home care need close attention. There are really good home care workers, and unfortunately some really unsatisfactory home care workers. However, most are neither stars nor failures. Most home care workers bring a mix of talents to the job. Your responsibility is to determine whether their strengths outweigh their weaknesses in meeting your loved one’s needs. It is useful to contract with any home care worker on a trial basis. It takes two or three weeks to determine if your loved one, the home care worker, and you are a good match for each other. Personalities and individual styles make a difference. Whether it is important to match up with other team members also needs to be determined.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/working-successfully-home-care-services/,Working Successfully with Home Care Services,"The home care worker should be able to make a connection with your loved one and provide companionship. If your loved one is no longer able to connect with others, does the worker demonstrate gentleness and respect in working with him or her?
 Tasks that involve the health or safety of your loved one should be demonstrated to the worker, be demonstrated back to you by them, and reviewed from time to time. For example, your Dad, who is a big man and is paralyzed from a stroke, transfers bed to chair in a specific way. A good worker will be able to safely maintain this routine. If your loved one uses oxygen or a Hoyer lift or a transfer bench, after demonstration by you and redemonstration by the worker, the worker should understand how to use the equipment safely and appropriately. If there are medical treatment plans to be followed (such as routine medications, daily weights, therapeutic diets), the worker should follow your instructions exactly. The worker should also follow your directions on what to do if, for any reason, the plan cannot be completed as directed.
 It is essential to discuss emergency procedures with the home care worker. You should ascertain the worker’s understanding of how and when to call 911. Some workers are new to this country and are unfamiliar with many aspects of day-to-day life in the United States. Do not assume that the worker knows these procedures. If your loved one has a written “Do Not Resuscitate” directive, does the worker know where it is? Does the worker know which part of the team needs to be called about the emergency? If a situation is not an emergency but is urgent, how do you want the worker to handle this? Do you want the worker to take messages from the doctor or the visiting nurse? Is your contact information up-to-date?
 Accountability is essential and needs to be discussed even before the start of care. If your loved one cannot be left alone, coverage for absences must be clarified. Will the agency or private contractor provide back-up? Is this acceptable to you? Sometimes the answer is yes and sometimes no. Care receivers will have problems despite the best of care. And care receivers will definitely have problems from substandard care. There are times when workers need to be fired. There are times when the worker needs to be reassured that she did the best that she could. And by all means, there are times for praise.",[]
https://www.caregiver.org/resource/working-successfully-home-care-services/,Working Successfully with Home Care Services,"A home care plan does not totally relieve you of your involvement in your loved one’s care. The situation will still be stressful in some ways. If the plan you have developed cannot be fixed, change it. Change the duties; change the worker; get professional advice. Allow that things will not go exactly as you envision. Focus on the priorities. Is your loved one safe? Is your loved one’s health being maintained? Is your loved one connected to the home care worker? If you answer yes to these three questions, then maybe some of the rest is not so important.
