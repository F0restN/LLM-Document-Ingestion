3,What Is Dementia?,"Alzheimer’s disease, the most common dementia diagnosis among older adults. Alzheimer’s dementia is typically associated with abnormal buildups of proteins in the brain — known as amyloid plaques and tau tangles — along with a loss of connection among nerve cells. These changes can be seen during life using a PET scan. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which is rare and tends to occur in people younger than 60. FTD is named for the areas of the brain affected. Changes in the frontal lobe lead to behavioral symptoms, whereas changes in the temporal lobe lead to problems with language and emotions. These changes include abnormal amounts or forms of the proteins tau and TDP-43, and the loss of nerve cells. Lewy body dementia (LBD), with symptoms that include problems with thinking, movement, behavior, and mood. People with LBD have abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein in the brain, also called Lewy bodies. Vascular dementia, a diagnosis of dementia in people who have vascular changes in the brain, such as a stroke or injury to small vessels carrying blood to the brain. People diagnosed with a vascular dementia may also show changes in the brain’s white matter, i.e., the connecting ""wires"" of the brain that relay messages between regions. These changes can be seen with an MRI. Mixed dementia, which refers to a diagnosis of dementia that is thought to be connected to a mixture of changes in the brain. For example, a person might have evidence of changes traditionally associated with both Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia. Researchers are continuing to explore how and why multiple distinct dementia-related brain changes can develop at the same time. This will help them better understand these various disorders and develop personalized prevention and treatment strategies. Together, the conditions are often referred to as Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias because they share many features and may commonly occur together.",https://www.alzheimers.gov/alzheimers-dementias/what-is-dementia

They also continue to explore the variety of disorders and disease processes that contribute to dementia, including previously unidentified causes. For example, researchers recently characterized a brain disorder involving the TDP-43 protein called limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy, or LATE. LATE causes symptoms similar to Alzheimer’s, including memory loss, but has different underlying causes. Researchers identified LATE based on results of autopsy studies that revealed build-ups of the protein TDP-43. Recent research suggests that LATE can contribute to cognitive decline alone or in combination with other types of dementia and that people over the age of 80 are at the greatest risk. LATE can currently only be diagnosed after death through an autopsy. Researchers are working to further explore the causes of and risk factors for LATE and to identify ways that could help doctors diagnose and treat it.",https://www.alzheimers.gov/alzheimers-dementias/what-is-dementia

Movement disorders happen when the parts of the brain that control movement are affected. There are two types of rare movement disorders associated with FTD: corticobasal syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy. Other movement-related disorders include frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism and frontotemporal dementia with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD-ALS). Symptoms can vary among these movement disorders.",https://www.alzheimers.gov/alzheimers-dementias/frontotemporal-dementia
4,What Is Frontotemporal Dementia?,"What Causes Frontotemporal Dementia? The underlying causes of frontotemporal dementia are not yet fully understood. People with FTD have abnormal amounts or forms of proteins called tau and TDP-43 inside nerve cells, or neurons, in their brain. The neurons die because the buildup of these proteins causes damage. In some cases, changes or differences in genes can be identified as the cause of FTD. For example, about 10% to 30% of bvFTD cases can be attributed to genetic causes. People with a family history of FTD are more likely to have a genetic form of the disease.",https://www.alzheimers.gov/alzheimers-dementias/frontotemporal-dementia
4,What Is Frontotemporal Dementia?,What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Frontotemporal Dementia? The signs and symptoms of frontotemporal dementia vary from person to person and the order in which they appear can also vary. Changes in the frontal lobe of the brain are generally associated with behavioral symptoms and may also lead to movement symptoms. Changes in the temporal lobe generally lead to disorders of language and emotion.,https://www.alzheimers.gov/alzheimers-dementias/frontotemporal-dementia

4,What Is Frontotemporal Dementia?,"To diagnose frontotemporal dementia, a doctor may perform an exam and ask about symptoms, look at personal and family medical history, use tests to help rule out other conditions, order genetic testing, conduct an assessment of the mind and behavior, and order imaging of the brain. Only genetic tests in familial cases or a brain autopsy after a person dies can confirm a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia.

4,What Is Frontotemporal Dementia?,"Maintain a schedule, decrease distractions, and change the environment to help with behavioral issues. For example, if compulsive eating is an issue, consider limiting food choices, locking cabinets and the refrigerator, and distracting the person with other activities. Try to recognize it’s the illness “talking” and accept rather than challenge people with behavioral symptoms. Arguing or reasoning will not help because they cannot control their behaviors or even see that they are unusual or upsetting to others. Limit choices and offer specific choices, such as “Do you want to go to the park or for a walk?” rather than, “What do you want to do today?” If you become frustrated, take a timeout — take deep breaths, count to 10, or leave the room for a few minutes. To help with language issues, speak slowly and clearly, use simple sentences, wait for responses, and ask for clarification if you don’t understand something. An album of labeled photos of people and objects, gestures, and drawing may help communicate without talking. A speech-language pathologist can determine the best tools and strategies for a particular person. Medications, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, may help treat certain behavioral symptoms. There are also medications that may help with movement problems, and physical and occupational therapy may provide some relief. Contact an academic medical center in your community to find a specialist and learn more about possible treatments.

5,What Is Lewy Body Dementia?,"What Causes Lewy Body Dementia? In people with LBD, abnormal clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein accumulate in areas of the brain involved in thinking, memory, and movement. The clumps are called ""Lewy bodies"" after the doctor who discovered them. They build up inside neurons, or nerve cells, in the brain and cause the neurons not to work well and eventually die.
